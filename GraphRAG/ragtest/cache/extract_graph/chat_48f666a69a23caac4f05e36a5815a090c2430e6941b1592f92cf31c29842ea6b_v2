Finally, these rewards are used to optimise\nthe SFT model using the PPO algorithm. Therefore the dataset should contain a text column which we\ncan rename to query. Each of the other data-points required to optimise the SFT model are obtained\nduring the training loop.\n6.8.1\nBenefits of PPO\n1. Stability: Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) is designed to ensure stable and reliable policy\nupdates. The clipped surrogate objective function is central to this stability, as it limits policy\nupdates to prevent large, potentially destabilising changes. This results in smoother and more\nconsistent learning.\n2. Ease of Implementation: Compared to advanced algorithms TRPO, PPO is relatively straight-\nforward to implement. It avoids the need for second-order optimisation techniques, making it more\n4https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/en/index\n5https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/main/en/ppo_trainer\n51\naccessible to less experienced practitioners.\n3. Sample Efficiency: PPO achieves data efficiency through its use of the clipped surrogate objec-\ntive. This mechanism regulates policy updates, ensuring stability while effectively reusing training\ndata.\nConsequently, PPO tends to be more sample-efficient than other reinforcement learning\nalgorithms, performing well with fewer samples, which is advantageous in scenarios where data\ncollection is costly or time-consuming.\n6.8.2\nLimitations of PPO\n1. Complexity and Computational Cost: Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) involves intricate\npolicy and value networks, necessitating substantial computational resources for training. This\ncomplexity often results in extended training durations and increased operational expenses.\n2. Hyperparameter Sensitivity: PPO’s performance is highly dependent on several hyperparame-\nters, such as the clipping range, learning rate, and discount factor. Achieving optimal performance\nrequires meticulous tuning of these parameters. Incorrect settings can lead to suboptimal policy\noutcomes or instability during the learning process.\n3. Stability and Convergence Issues: Although PPO is designed to enhance stability compared\nto earlier methods, it can still encounter convergence issues, particularly in highly dynamic or\ncomplex environments. Maintaining stable policy updates remains a significant challenge.\n4. Reward Signal Dependence: PPO’s effectiveness is heavily reliant on a well-defined reward\nsignal to guide the learning process. In scenarios where designing an appropriate reward function\nis challenging or impractical, PPO may struggle to attain the desired results.\n6.8.3\nTutorial for training models using PPO technique\nThe tutorial for tuning GPT2 to generate positive movie reviews based on the IMDB dataset using PPO\ntechnique can be found here.\n6.9\nDirect Preference Optimisation (DPO)\nDirect Preference Optimisation (DPO) [74] offers a streamlined approach to aligning language models\n(LMs) with human preferences, bypassing the complexity of reinforcement learning from human feedback\n(RLHF). Large-scale unsupervised LMs typically lack precise behavioural control, necessitating meth-\nods like RLHF that fine-tune models using human feedback. However, RLHF is intricate, involving the\ncreation of reward models and the fine-tuning of LMs to maximise estimated rewards, which can be\nunstable and computationally demanding. DPO addresses these challenges by directly optimising LMs\nwith a simple classification objective that aligns responses with human preferences. This approach elim-\ninates the need for explicit reward modelling and extensive hyperparameter tuning, enhancing stability\nand efficiency. DPO optimises the desired behaviours by increasing the relative likelihood of preferred\nresponses while incorporating dynamic importance weights to prevent model degeneration. Thus, DPO\nsimplifies the preference learning pipeline, making it an effective method for training LMs to adhere to\nhuman preferences.\nPython Library - HuggingFace TRL package supports the DPO Trainer6 for training language models\nfrom the preference data. The DPO training process requires a dataset formatted in a very specific\nmanner. If you are utilising the default DPODataCollatorWithPadding data collator, your final dataset\nobject must include three specific entries, which should be labelled as follows:\n• Prompt\n• Chosen\n• Rejected\nHuggingFace offers datasets compatible with DPO and can be accessed here.\n6https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/main/en/dpo_trainer\n52\nFigure 6.12: Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) Process Flow. This figure illustrates the Direct\nPreference Optimisation (DPO) technique used in fine-tuning large language models. The process begins\nwith preference data (Yw > Yl), where Yw represents preferred outputs, and Yl represents less preferred\noutputs. Through a maximum likelihood estimation process, this preference data is used to optimise\nthe model’s parameters, resulting in the final large language model (LLM). The method is designed to\nimprove the alignment of model outputs with desired user preferences, enhancing the model’s effectiveness\nin specific tasks. (adapted from [74])\n6.9.1\nBenefits of DPO\n1. Direct Alignment with Human Preferences: DPO directly optimises models to generate\nresponses that align with human preferences, thereby producing more favourable outputs.\n2. Minimised Dependence on Proxy Objectives: In contrast to methods that rely on next-\nword prediction, DPO leverages explicit human preferences, resulting in responses that are more\nreflective of human behaviour.\n3. Enhanced Performance on Subjective Tasks: For tasks requiring subjective judgement, such\nas dialogue generation or creative writing, DPO excels in aligning the model with human prefer-\nences.\n6.9.2\nBest Practices for DPO\n1.
