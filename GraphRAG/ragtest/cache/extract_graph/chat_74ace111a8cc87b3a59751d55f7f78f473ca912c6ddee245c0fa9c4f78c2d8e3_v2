This process assists AI\ndevelopers and engineers in addressing the challenges associated with deploying AI models in resource-\nlimited environments, such as mobile devices, edge computing, or embedded systems. Pruning AI models\ncan be achieved through various techniques, each suited to the type and structure of the neural network,\nthe pruning objective, and the pruning criterion. The following are common approaches:\n1. Weight Pruning: Involves removing weights or connections with minimal magnitude or impact on\nthe output. This method reduces the number of parameters and operations in the model, although\nit may not necessarily decrease memory footprint or latency.\n2. Unit Pruning: Eliminates entire units or neurons with the lowest activation or contribution to\nthe output. This technique can reduce the model’s memory footprint and latency but may require\nretraining or fine-tuning to maintain performance.\n3. Filter Pruning: Involves removing entire filters or channels in convolutional neural networks that\nhave the least importance or relevance to the output. This strategy also reduces memory footprint\nand latency, though it may necessitate retraining or fine-tuning to preserve performance [78].\n6.11.1\nWhen to Prune AI Models?\nPruning AI models can be conducted at various stages of the model development and deployment cycle,\ncontingent on the chosen technique and objective.\n1. Pre-Training Pruning: Leverages prior knowledge or heuristics to determine the optimal network\nstructure before training begins. This approach can save time and resources during training but\nmay necessitate careful design and experimentation to identify the best configuration.\n2. Post-Training Pruning: Involves using metrics or criteria to assess the importance or impact of\neach network component after training. This method helps maintain model performance but may\nrequire additional validation and testing to ensure quality and robustness.\n3. Dynamic Pruning: Adjusts the network structure during inference or runtime based on feedback\nor signals. This approach can optimise the model for different scenarios or tasks but may involve\nhigher computational overhead and complexity to implement and execute.\n6.11.2\nBenefits of Pruning\n1. Reduced Size and Complexity: Pruning decreases the size and complexity of AI models, making\nthem easier to store, transmit, and update.\n2. Improved Efficiency and Performance: Pruned models are faster, more energy-efficient, and\nmore reliable.\n3. Enhanced generalisation and Accuracy: Pruning can make models more robust, less prone\nto overfitting, and more adaptable to new data or tasks.\n55\n6.11.3\nChallenges of Pruning\n1. Balance Between Size Reduction and Performance: Achieving the optimal balance between\nreducing size and complexity and maintaining performance is challenging; excessive or insufficient\npruning can degrade model quality and functionality.\n2. Choosing Appropriate Techniques: Selecting the right pruning technique, criterion, and objec-\ntive for the specific neural network type and structure is crucial, as different methods can produce\nvarying effects and outcomes.\n3. Evaluation and Validation: Pruned models need thorough evaluation and validation to ensure\npruning has not introduced errors, biases, or vulnerabilities that could impact performance and\nrobustness.\n56\nChapter 7\nStage 5: Evaluation and Validation\n7.1\nSteps Involved in Evaluating and Validating Fine-Tuned\nModels\n1. Set Up Evaluation Metrics: Choose appropriate evaluation metrics, such as cross-entropy, to\nmeasure the difference between the predicted and actual distributions of the data.\n2. Interpret Training Loss Curve: Monitor and analyse the training loss curve to ensure the\nmodel is learning effectively, avoiding patterns of underfitting or overfitting.\n3. Run Validation Loops: After each training epoch, evaluate the model on the validation set to\ncompute relevant performance metrics and track the model’s generalisation ability.\n4. Monitor and Interpret Results: Consistently observe the relationship between training and\nvalidation metrics to ensure stable and effective model performance.\n5. Hyperparameter Tuning and Adjustments: Adjust key hyperparameters such as learning\nrate, batch size, and number of training epochs to optimise model performance and prevent over-\nfitting.\n7.2\nSetting Up Evaluation Metrics\nCross-entropy is a key metric for evaluating LLMs during training or fine-tuning.\nOriginating from\ninformation theory, it quantifies the difference between two probability distributions.\n7.2.1\nImportance of Cross-Entropy for LLM Training and Evaluation\nCross-entropy is crucial for training and fine-tuning LLMs. It serves as a loss function, guiding the model\nto produce high-quality predictions by minimising discrepancies between the predicted and actual data.\nIn LLMs, each potential word functions as a separate class, and the model’s task is to predict the next\nword given the context. This task is inherently complex, requiring\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama3.2:3b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_74ace111a8cc87b3a59751d55f7f78f473ca912c6ddee245c0fa9c4f78c2d8e3_v2"}
