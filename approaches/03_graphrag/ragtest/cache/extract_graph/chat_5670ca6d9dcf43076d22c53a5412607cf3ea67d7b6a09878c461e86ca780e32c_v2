This technique is appli-\ncable to various modalities, such as financial sentiment classification and machine translation of medical\nterminologies. A taxonomy of PEFT-based fine-tuning approaches is provided in Figure6.1. We will\nfurther discuss a few key PEFT-based approaches in the following sections.\n6.3.1\nAdapters\nAdapter-based methods introduce additional trainable parameters after the attention and fully connected\nlayers of a frozen pre-trained model, aiming to reduce memory usage and accelerate training. The specific\napproach varies depending on the adapter; it might involve adding an extra layer or representing the\nweight updates delta (W) as a low-rank decomposition of the weight matrix. Regardless of the method,\nadapters are generally small yet achieve performance comparable to fully fine-tuned models, allowing for\nthe training of larger models with fewer resources.\nHuggingFace supports adapter configurations through the PEFT library. During fine-tuning, new adapters\nare integrated into the model using LoraConfig 1. HuggingFace uses PeftConfig to load existing pre-\ntrained models and apply PEFT techniques. Additionally, HuggingFace provides built-in support to\n1https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/en/package_reference/lora\n37\nFigure 6.1: Comprehensive Taxonomy of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) Methods for Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs). This figure categorises various PEFT techniques, highlighting their distinct\napproaches, from additive and selective fine-tuning to reparameterised and hybrid methods. It details\nspecific strategies within each category, such as Adapter-Based Fine-Tuning, Soft Prompt-Based Fine-\nTuning, and their respective sub-techniques like LoRA and its derivatives, showcasing the diverse and\nevolving landscape of LLM fine-tuning. (adapted from [60])\nrun the fine-tuning process across any distributed configuration using Accelerate2, making large-scale\ntraining and inference simple, efficient, and adaptable.\n6.3.2\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\nLow-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)[62] is a technique designed for fine-tuning large language models, which\nmodifies the fine-tuning process by freezing the original model weights and applying changes to a separate\nset of weights, added to the original parameters. LoRA transforms the model parameters into a lower-\nrank dimension, reducing the number of trainable parameters, speeding up the process, and lowering\ncosts. This method is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple clients require fine-tuned models\nfor different applications, allowing for the creation of specific weights for each use case without the\nneed for separate models. By employing low-rank approximation methods, LoRA effectively reduces\ncomputational and resource requirements while preserving the pre-trained model’s adaptability to specific\ntasks or domains.\nBenefits of Using LoRA\n1. Parameter Efficiency: LoRA significantly reduces the number of parameters that need to be\ntrained by focusing only on the low-rank matrices, resulting in lower memory and storage require-\nments compared to full fine-tuning.\n2. Efficient Storage: The storage of the trained model is more efficient as it only requires storing\nthe low-rank matrices instead of the full model weights.\n2https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/en/index\n38\nFigure 6.2: Schematic representation of the Adapter Architecture used in LLMs. The diagram showcases\nthe integration of adapters within the Transformer architecture, including the feed-forward up and down\nlayers and their role in enabling efficient model adaptation by inserting additional parameters while\nmaintaining the model’s core structure (adapted from [61])\n3. Reduced Computational Load: Training with low-rank matrices requires fewer computational\nresources, making it faster and more scalable.\n4. Lower Memory Footprint: Since fewer parameters are being updated, the memory footprint\nduring training is reduced, enabling the use of larger batch sizes or more complex models within\nthe same hardware constraints.\n5. Flexibility: LoRA can be easily integrated with existing pre-trained models without extensive\nmodifications to the model architecture.\n6. Compatibility: It can be used alongside other fine-tuning techniques, such as adapter layers or\nprompt-tuning, to further enhance performance.\n7. Comparable Results: Despite the reduction in the number of trainable parameters, LoRA has\nbeen shown to achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning in many tasks.\n8. Task-Specific Adaptation: It effectively adapts the pre-trained model to specific tasks, leverag-\ning the knowledge already embedded in the original model.\n9. Avoiding Overfitting: By focusing on low-rank updates, LoRA can help in mitigating overfitting,\nespecially when dealing with smaller task-specific datasets.\nLimitations\nWhile LoRA demonstrates considerable power, it also presents challenges:\n• Fine-tuning Scope: LoRA may face difficulties when applied to tasks demanding substantial\nalterations to the pre-trained model’s internal representations.\n• Hyperparameter Optimisation: Tuning the rank parameter ‘r’ requires meticulous adjustment\nfor optimal performance.\n• Ongoing Research: Despite its promise, LoRA is still in active research stages, and its long-term\nimplications remain to be fully explored.\n39\nFigure 6.3: A comparison between weight updates in regular fine-tuning and LoRA fine-tuning.\nIn\nregular fine-tuning, the entire weight update matrix (∆W) is applied to the pre-trained weights. In\ncontrast, LoRA fine-tuning introduces two low-rank matrices (A and B) that approximate the weight\nupdate matrix (∆W), significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters by leveraging the inner\ndimension (r), which is a hyperparameter.\nThis method is more efficient in terms of memory and\ncomputation,\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama3.2:3b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_5670ca6d9dcf43076d22c53a5412607cf3ea67d7b6a09878c461e86ca780e32c_v2"}
