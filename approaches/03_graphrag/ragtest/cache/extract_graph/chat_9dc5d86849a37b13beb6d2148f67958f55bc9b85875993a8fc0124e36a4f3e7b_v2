This discussion focuses on the two main aspects: the\nchallenges in scaling fine-tuning processes and potential research directions for scalable solutions.\n12.1.1\nChallenges in Scaling Fine-Tuning Processes\n1. Computational Resources: Large-scale models such as GPT-3 and PaLM require enormous\ncomputational resources for fine-tuning. For instance, fine-tuning a 175-billion parameter model\nlike GPT-3 necessitates high-performance GPUs or TPUs capable of handling vast amounts of data\nand complex operations. The sheer volume of parameters translates to extensive computational\ndemands. Even a relatively smaller model, such as BERT-large with 340 million parameters, can\nbe computationally intensive to fine-tune.\n2. Memory Requirements: The memory footprint for fine-tuning LLMs is staggering. Each pa-\nrameter in the model requires storage, and during training, additional memory is needed to store\nintermediate computations, gradients, and optimiser states. For example, loading a 7 billion pa-\nrameter model (e.g., LLaMA 2) in FP32 (4 bytes per parameter) requires approximately 28 GB\nof GPU memory, while fine-tuning demands around 112 GB of GPU memory[105]. This memory\ndemand is beyond the capability of most consumer-grade hardware, making fine-tuning accessible\nprimarily to well-funded organisations or research institutions.\n3. Data Volume: LLMs typically require vast amounts of training data to achieve state-of-the-art\nperformance during fine-tuning. This data needs to be loaded, preprocessed, and fed into the model\nat high speeds to maintain efficient training. Managing large datasets can become a bottleneck,\nespecially if the data is stored in a distributed fashion across multiple systems or if it needs to be\nfetched from remote storage.\n4. Throughput and Bottlenecks: High throughput is essential to keep GPUs or TPUs fully\nutilised. However, data pipelines can become bottlenecks if not properly optimised. For exam-\nple, shuffling large datasets or loading them into memory quickly enough to keep up with the\ntraining process can be challenging. Techniques like data packing, where multiple small examples\nare combined into larger batches, help improve throughput but add complexity to data handling\nroutines.[106]\n5. Efficient Use of Resources: The financial and environmental costs of fine-tuning large models\nare significant. Large-scale fine-tuning involves not just the direct cost of computational resources\nbut also the indirect costs associated with energy consumption and infrastructure maintenance.\n1https://ai.google/discover/palm2/\n2https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/t5\n97\nTechniques such as mixed-precision training and gradient checkpointing can reduce these costs by\noptimising memory and computational efficiency.\nThe challenges in scaling the fine-tuning processes of LLMs are multifaceted and complex, involving sig-\nnificant computational, memory, and data handling constraints. Innovations in PEFT, data throughput\noptimisation, and resource-efficient training methods are critical for overcoming these challenges. As\nLLMs continue to grow in size and capability, addressing these challenges will be essential for making\nadvanced AI accessible and practical for a wider range of applications.\n12.1.2\nResearch Directions for Scalable Solutions\nAdvanced PEFT Techniques and Sparse Fine-Tuning\nRecent advancements in PEFT techniques, like LoRA and its variant, Quantised LoRA, are revolu-\ntionising the scalability of LLMs. LoRA reduces the computational burden by updating only a low-rank\napproximation of the parameters, significantly lowering memory and processing requirements. Quantised\nLoRA further optimises resource usage by applying quantisation to these low-rank matrices, maintaining\nhigh model performance while minimising the need for extensive hardware. This has enabled efficient\nfine-tuning of massive models, such as in Meta’s LLaMA project, where adapting a smaller set of influ-\nential parameters allowed the models to perform robustly across various tasks with less computational\nstrain.\nSparse fine-tuning techniques, such as SpIEL [107] complement these efforts by selectively updating\nonly the most impactful parameters. SpIEL fine-tunes models by only changing a small portion of the\nparameters, which\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama3.2:3b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_9dc5d86849a37b13beb6d2148f67958f55bc9b85875993a8fc0124e36a4f3e7b_v2"}
