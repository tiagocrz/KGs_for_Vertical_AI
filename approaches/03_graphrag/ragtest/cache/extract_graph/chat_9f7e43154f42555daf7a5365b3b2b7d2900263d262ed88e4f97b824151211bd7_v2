This allows for timely optimisations and adjust-\nments to maintain accuracy and efficiency over time.\n• Integration with AWS Services: Leverage AWS’s comprehensive suite of services and inte-\ngration capabilities to create end-to-end pipelines that ensure reliable and scalable deployment of\nlarge-scale language models across diverse operational environments.\n10.4.3\nLimitations of Using JumpStart\n• Limited Customisation: While JumpStart simplifies the process for common use cases, it may\noffer limited flexibility for highly specialised or complex applications that require significant cus-\ntomisation beyond the provided templates and workflows.\n• Dependency on AWS Ecosystem: JumpStart is tightly integrated with AWS services, which\nmay pose challenges for users who prefer or need to operate in multi-cloud environments or those\nwith existing infrastructure outside of AWS.\n• Resource Costs: Utilising SageMaker’s scalable resources for fine-tuning LLMs, especially large\nmodels, can incur substantial costs, which might be a barrier for smaller organisations or those\nwith limited budgets.\n10.4.4\nTutorials\n1. Fine-Tuning LLaMA 2 with Amazon SageMaker JumpStart\n2. LLM Agents Using AWS SageMaker JumpStart Foundation Models\n10.5\nAmazon Bedrock\nAmazon Bedrock7 is a fully managed service designed to simplify access to high-performing foundation\nmodels (FMs) from top AI innovators like AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI, Stability\nAI, and Amazon. It provides a unified API that integrates these models and offers extensive capabilities\nfor developing secure, private, and responsible generative AI applications. With Amazon Bedrock, users\ncan effortlessly experiment with and assess leading FMs tailored to their specific needs. The service sup-\nports private customisation of models through fine-tuning and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG),\nenabling the creation of intelligent agents that leverage enterprise data and systems. Amazon Bedrock’s\nserverless architecture allows for quick deployment, seamless integration, and secure customisation of\nFMs without the burden of infrastructure management, Utilising AWS tools to deploy these models into\napplications efficiently and securely.\n10.5.1\nSteps Involved in Using Amazon Bedrock\nAmazon Bedrock offers a streamlined workflow for deploying and fine-tuning LLMs, making it an ideal\nchoice for businesses looking to quickly integrate advanced AI capabilities into their operations. Here’s\na high-level overview of how Bedrock operates:\n• Model Selection: Users start by choosing from a curated selection of foundation models available\nthrough Bedrock. These include models from AWS (like Amazon Titan) and third-party providers\n(such as Anthropic Claude and Stability AI).\n• Fine-Tuning:\n– Once a model is selected, users can fine-tune it to better fit their specific needs. This involves\nfeeding the model with domain-specific data or task-specific instructions to tailor its outputs.\n7https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/\n84\n– The fine-tuning process is handled via simple API calls, eliminating the need for extensive\nsetup or detailed configuration. Users provide their custom data, and Bedrock manages the\ntraining process in the background.\n• Deployment:\n– After fine-tuning, Bedrock takes care of deploying the model in a scalable and efficient manner.\nThis means that users can quickly integrate the fine-tuned model into their applications or\nservices.\n– Bedrock ensures that the model scales according to demand and handles performance optimi-\nsation, providing a seamless user experience.\n• Integration and Monitoring:\n– Bedrock integrates smoothly with other AWS services, allowing users to embed AI capabilities\ndirectly into their existing AWS ecosystem.\n– Users can monitor and manage the performance of their deployed models through AWS’s\ncomprehensive monitoring tools, ensuring that the models continue to perform optimally.\n10.5.2\nLimitations of Using Amazon Bedrock\nWhile Amazon Bedrock offers a robust suite of tools and services for addressing certain AI challenges,\nit is not a comprehensive solution for all AI needs. One key limitation is that it does not eliminate the\nrequirement for human expertise. Organisations still need skilled professionals who understand the in-\ntricacies of AI technology to effectively develop, fine-tune, and optimise the models provided by Bedrock.\nAdditionally, Amazon Bedrock is not designed to function as a standalone service. It relies on integration\nwith other AWS services, such as Amazon S3 for data storage, AWS Lambda for serverless computing,\nand AWS SageMaker for machine learning model development. Therefore, businesses leveraging Amazon\nBedrock will also need to use these complementary AWS services to fully realise its potential. This\ninterconnectedness means that while Amazon Bedrock enhances the AI capabilities within an AWS\necosystem, it may present a steep learning curve and require significant infrastructure management for\nthose new to AWS.\n10.5.3\nT\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama3.2:3b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_9f7e43154f42555daf7a5365b3b2b7d2900263d262ed88e4f97b824151211bd7_v2"}
