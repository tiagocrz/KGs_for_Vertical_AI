It reduces the computational burden per iteration and often converges\nfaster than batch Gradient Descent. However, it requires a smaller learning rate due to higher variance\nand benefits from momentum to stabilise updates.\nPros:\n• Fast and handles large datasets well.\n• Efficient memory usage.\n28\n• Simple and easy to implement.\n• Can escape local minima due to noise.\nCons:\n• High variance in updates can lead to instability.\n• Can overshoot the minimum.\n• Sensitive to the choice of learning rate.\n• Can be slower to converge compared to batch methods.\nWhen to Use: SGD is ideal for large datasets, incremental learning scenarios, and real-time learning\nenvironments where computational resources are limited.\n5.4.3\nMini-batch Gradient Descent\nMini-batch Gradient Descent combines the efficiency of SGD and the stability of batch Gradient Descent,\noffering a compromise between batch and stochastic approaches.\nHow it Works: It splits data into small batches and updates parameters using gradients averaged\nover each mini-batch. This reduces variance compared to SGD and is more efficient than batch Gradient\nDescent, helping in generalising the updates.\nPros:\n• Balances between efficiency and stability.\n• More generalisable updates.\n• Reduces the variance of parameter updates.\n• Provides a compromise between SGD and batch.\nCons:\n• Requires tuning of batch size.\n• Can still be computationally expensive for very large datasets.\n• More complex implementation.\n• Can require more iterations than full-batch Gradient Descent.\nWhen to Use: Mini-batch Gradient Descent is suitable for most deep learning tasks, especially\nwhen working with moderate to large datasets.\n5.4.4\nAdaGrad\nAdaptive Gradient Algorithm (AdaGrad) is designed for sparse data and high-dimensional models, ad-\njusting learning rates to improve performance on sparse data.\nHow it Works: AdaGrad adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on historical gradi-\nent information, accumulating squared gradients. This approach prevents large updates for frequent\nparameters and helps in dealing with sparse features.\nPros:\n• Adapts learning rate for each parameter.\n• Good for sparse data.\n• No need to manually tune learning rates.\n• Works well with high-dimensional data.\nCons:\n• Learning rate can diminish to zero, stopping learning.\n29\n• May require more tuning for convergence.\n• Accumulation of squared gradients can lead to overly small learning rates.\n• Can slow down significantly.\nWhen to Use: AdaGrad is useful for sparse datasets like text and images where learning rates need\nto adapt to feature frequency.\n5.4.5\nRMSprop\nRoot Mean Square Propagation (RMSprop) is an adaptive learning rate method designed to perform\nbetter on non-stationary and online problems.\nHow it Works: RMSprop modifies AdaGrad by using a moving average of squared gradients to\nadapt learning rates based on recent gradient magnitudes. It maintains a running average of squared\ngradients to help in maintaining steady learning rates.\nPros:\n• Addresses the diminishing learning rate problem of AdaGrad.\n• Adapts learning rate based on recent gradients.\n• Effective for recurrent neural networks.\n• More robust against non-stationary targets.\nCons:\n• Can still get stuck in local minima on non-convex problems.\n• Requires hyperparameter tuning.\n• Requires careful tuning of the decay rate.\n• Can be sensitive to the initial learning rate.\nWhen to Use: RMSprop is best for non-convex optimisation problems, training RNNs and LSTMs,\nand dealing with noisy or non-stationary objectives.\n5.4.6\nAdaDelta\nAdaptive Delta (AdaDelta) improves on AdaGrad and RMSprop, focusing on adaptive learning rates\nwithout diminishing too quickly.\nHow it Works: AdaDelta eliminates the need for a default learning rate by using a moving window\nof gradient updates. It adapts learning rates based on recent gradient magnitudes to ensure consistent\nupdates even with sparse gradients.\nPros:\n• Eliminates the need to set a default learning rate.\n• Addresses the diminishing learning rate issue.\n• Does not require manual tuning of the learning rate.\n• Handles gradient sparsity well.\nCons:\n• More complex than RMSprop and AdaGrad.\n• Can have slower convergence initially.\n• Can require more iterations to converge.\n• Implementation can be more complex.\nWhen to Use: AdaDelta is suitable for scenarios similar to RMSprop but is preferred when avoiding\nmanual learning rate setting.\n30\n5.4.7\nAdam\nAdaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) combines the advantages of AdaGrad and RMSprop, making it\nsuitable for problems with large datasets and high-dimensional spaces.\nHow it Works: Adam uses running averages of both gradients and their squared values to com-\npute adaptive learning rates for each parameter. It includes bias correction and often achieves faster\nconvergence than other methods.\nPros:\n• Combines advantages of AdaGrad and RMSprop.\n• Adaptive learning rates.\n• Includes bias correction.\n• Fast convergence.\n• Works well with large datasets and high-dimensional spaces.\nCons:\n• Requires tuning of hyperparameters (though it often works well with defaults).\n• Computationally intensive.\n• Can lead to overfitting if not regularised properly.\n• Requires more memory.\nWhen to Use: Adam is widely used in most deep learning applications due to its efficiency and\neffectiveness, particularly in complex neural network architectures.\n5.4.8\nAdamW\nAdamW is an extension of Adam that includes weight decay regularisation to address overfitting issues\npresent in Adam.\nHow it Works\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama3.2:3b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_ad94abf07bd7bd463c3c1a16c7c7589ece39bbdecfe1036d3276defd4e7f925c_v2"}
