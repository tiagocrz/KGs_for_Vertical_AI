Reduced Data Requirements: Fine-tuning requires less labelled data, focusing on tailoring\npre-trained features to the target task.\n3. Improved Generalisation: Fine-tuning enhances the model’s ability to generalise to specific\ntasks or domains, capturing general language features and customising them.\n4. Efficient Model Deployment: Fine-tuned models are more efficient for real-world applications,\nbeing computationally efficient and well-suited for specific tasks.\n5. Adaptability to Various Tasks: Fine-tuned LLMs can adapt to a broad range of tasks, per-\nforming well across various applications without task-specific architectures.\n6. Domain-Specific Performance: Fine-tuning allows models to excel in domain-specific tasks by\nadjusting to the nuances and vocabulary of the target domain.\n10\n7. Faster Convergence: Fine-tuning usually achieves faster convergence, starting with weights that\nalready capture general language features.\n1.9\nRetrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)\nA popular method to utilise your own data is by incorporating it into the prompt when querying the LLM\nmodel. This approach, known as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), involves retrieving relevant\ndata and using it as additional context for the LLM. Instead of depending solely on knowledge from the\ntraining data, a RAG workflow pulls pertinent information, connecting static LLMs with real-time data\nretrieval. With RAG architecture, organisations can deploy any LLM model and enhance it to return\nrelevant results by providing a small amount of their own data (see Figure1.4 for visual workflow). This\nprocess avoids the costs and time associated with fine-tuning or pre-training the model.\nFigure 1.4: An illustration of the Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline steps,\ndepicting the sequential process from client query to response generation.\nThe pipeline starts with\nthe client’s question, followed by semantic search in a vector database, contextually enriching the data\nbefore generating a prompt for the large language model (LLM). The final response is post-processed\nand returned to the client.\n1.9.1\nTraditional RAG Pipeline and Steps\n1. Data Indexing: Organise data efficiently for quick retrieval. This involves processing, chunking,\nand storing data in a vector database using indexing strategies like search indexing, vector indexing,\nand hybrid indexing.\n2. Input Query Processing: Refine user queries to improve compatibility with indexed data. This\ncan include simplification or vector transformation of queries for enhanced search efficiency.\n3. Searching and Ranking: Retrieve and rank data based on relevance using search algorithms\nsuch as TF-IDF, BM25, and deep learning models like BERT to interpret the query’s intent and\ncontext.\n4. Prompt Augmentation: Incorporate relevant information from the search results into the origi-\nnal query to provide the LLM with additional context, enhancing response accuracy and relevance.\n11\n5. Response Generation: Use the augmented prompt to generate responses that combine the LLM’s\nknowledge with current, specific data, ensuring high-quality, contextually grounded answers.\n1.9.2\nBenefits of Using RAG\n• Up-to-Date and Accurate Responses: Enhances the LLM’s responses with current external\ndata, improving accuracy and relevance.\n• Reducing Inaccurate Responses: Grounds the LLM’s output in relevant knowledge, reducing\nthe risk of generating incorrect information.\n• Domain-Specific Responses: Delivers contextually relevant responses tailored to an organisa-\ntion’s proprietary data.\n• Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness: Offers a cost-effective method for customising LLMs without\nextensive model fine-tuning.\n1.9.3\nChallenges and Considerations in Serving RAG\n1. User Experience: Ensuring rapid response times suitable for real-time applications.\n2. Cost Efficiency: Managing the costs associated with serving millions of responses.\n3. Accuracy: Ensuring outputs are accurate to avoid misinformation.\n4. Recency and Relevance: Keeping responses and content current with the latest data.\n5. Business Context Awareness: Aligning LLM responses with specific business contexts.\n6. Service Scalability: Managing increased capacity while controlling costs.\n7. Security and Governance: Implementing protocols for data security, privacy, and governance.\n1.9.4\nUse Cases and Examples\n1. Question and Answer Chatbots: Integrate LLMs with chatbots to generate accurate answers\nfrom company documents, enhancing customer support.\n2. Search Augmentation: Enhance search engines with LLM-generated answers for more accurate\ninformational queries.\n3. Knowledge Engine: Use LLMs to answer questions related to internal functions, such as HR\nand compliance, using company data.\n1.9.5\nConsiderations for Choosing Between RAG and Fine-Tuning\nWhen considering external data access, RAG is likely a superior option for applications needing to access\nexternal data sources. Fine-tuning, on the other hand, is more suitable if you require the model to ad-\njust its behaviour, and writing style, or incorporate domain-specific knowledge. In terms of suppressing\nhallucinations and ensuring accuracy, RAG systems tend to perform better as they are less prone to gen-\nerating incorrect information. If you have ample domain-specific, labelled training data, fine-tuning can\nresult in a more tailored model behaviour, whereas RAG systems are robust alternatives when such data\nis scarce. RAG systems provide an advantage with dynamic data retrieval capabilities for environments\nwhere data frequently updates or changes. Additionally, it is crucial to ensure the transparency and\ninterpret ability of the model’s decision-making process. In that case, RAG systems offer insight that is\ntypically not available in models that are solely fine-tuned.
