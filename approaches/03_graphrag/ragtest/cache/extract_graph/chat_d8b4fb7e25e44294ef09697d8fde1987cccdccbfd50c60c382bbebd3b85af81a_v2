The following are the key techniques supported by Optimum:\n• Quantisation: Quantisation is one of the key techniques supported by Optimum. This process in-\nvolves converting the model’s weights from high-precision floating-point numbers to lower-precision\nformats, such as int8 or float16. This reduction in precision decreases the model’s memory foot-\nprint and computational requirements, enabling faster execution and lower power consumption,\nespecially on edge devices and mobile platforms. Optimum automates the quantisation process,\nmaking it accessible to users who may not have expertise in low-level hardware optimisation.\n• Pruning: Pruning is another critical optimisation strategy offered by Optimum. It involves iden-\ntifying and removing less significant weights from the LLM, reducing its overall complexity and\nsize. This leads to faster inference times and lower storage needs, which are particularly beneficial\nfor deploying models in environments with limited computational resources. Optimum’s pruning\nalgorithms carefully eliminate these redundant weights while maintaining the model’s performance,\nensuring that it continues to deliver high-quality results even after optimisation.\n• Model Distillation: In addition to these techniques, Optimum supports model distillation, a\nprocess where a smaller, more efficient model is trained to replicate the behaviour of a larger, more\ncomplex model. This distilled model retains much of the knowledge and capabilities of the original\nwhile being significantly lighter and faster. Optimum provides tools to facilitate the distillation\nprocess, allowing users to create compact LLMs that are well-suited for real-time applications. By\noffering a comprehensive suite of optimisation tools, Optimum ensures that HuggingFace’s LLMs\ncan be deployed effectively across a wide range of environments, from powerful cloud servers to\nresource-constrained edge devices.\n6https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/en/index\n81\n10.3.1\nBest Practices of Using Optimum\n• Understand Hardware Requirements: Assess the target deployment environment (e.g., edge\ndevices, cloud servers) to optimise model configuration accordingly.\n• Iterative Optimisation: Experiment with different optimisation techniques (quantisation levels,\npruning thresholds) to find the optimal balance between model size, speed, and accuracy.\n• Validation and Testing: Validate optimised models thoroughly to ensure they meet performance\nand accuracy requirements across different use cases.\n• Documentation and Support: Refer to HuggingFace’s resources for detailed guidance on using\nOptimum’s tools effectively, and leverage community support for troubleshooting and best practices\nsharing.\n• Continuous Monitoring: Monitor deployed models post-optimisation to detect any performance\ndegradation and adjust optimisation strategies as needed to maintain optimal performance over\ntime.\n10.3.2\nTutorials\n1. An Introduction to Using Transformers and Hugging Face\n10.4\nAmazon SageMaker JumpStart\nAmazon SageMaker JumpStart is a feature within the SageMaker ecosystem designed to simplify and\nexpedite the fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). It provides users with a rich library of pre-\nbuilt models and solutions that can be quickly customised for various use cases. This tool is particularly\nvaluable for organisations looking to deploy NLP solutions efficiently without deep expertise in machine\nlearning or the extensive computational resources typically required for training LLMs from scratch. The\narchitecture depicted in Figure 10.2 outlines a comprehensive pipeline for the fine-tuning and deployment\nof large language models (LLMs) Utilising AWS services.\n10.4.1\nSteps Involved in Using JumpStart\n• Data Preparation and Preprocessing:\n– Data Storage: Begin by securely storing raw datasets in Amazon S3, AWS’s scalable object\nstorage service.\n– Preprocessing: Utilise the EMR Serverless framework with Apache Spark for efficient data\npreprocessing. This step refines and prepares the raw data for subsequent model training and\nevaluation.\n– Data Refinement: Store the processed dataset back into Amazon S3 after preprocessing,\nensuring accessibility and readiness for the next stages.\n• Model Fine-Tuning with SageMaker JumpStart:\n– Model Selection: Choose from a variety of pre-built models and solutions available through\nSageMaker JumpStart’s extensive library, tailored for tasks such as sentiment analysis, text\ngeneration, or customer support automation.\n– Fine-Tuning Execution: Utilise Amazon SageMaker’s capabilities, integrated with Sage-\nMaker JumpStart, to fine-tune the selected model. This involves adjusting parameters and\nconfigurations to optimise the model’s performance for specific use cases.\n– Workflow Simplification: Leverage pre-built algorithms and model templates provided by\nSageMaker JumpStart to streamline the fine-tuning workflow, reducing the time and effort\nrequired for deployment.\n• Model Deployment and Hosting:\n82\nFigure 10.2: A step-by-step workflow illustrating the Amazon SageMaker JumpStart process, starting\nfrom data preprocessing using EMR Serverless Spark to the fine-tuning of LLMs, and ending with model\ndeployment on Amazon SageMaker Endpoints. (adapted from [85])\n– Deployment Setup: Deploy the fine-tuned model using Amazon SageMaker’s endpoint\ndeployment capabilities. This setup ensures that the model is hosted in a scalable environment\ncapable of handling real-time predictions efficiently.\n– Scalability: Benefit from AWS’s infrastructure scalability, allowing seamless scaling of re-\nsources to accommodate varying workloads and operational demands.\n– Efficiency and Accessibility: Ensure that the deployed model is accessible via SageMaker\nendpoints, enabling efficient integration into production applications for real-time inference\ntasks.\n10.4.2\nBest Practices for Using JumpStart\n• Robust Data Management: Maintain secure and organised data storage practices in Amazon\nS3\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama3.2:3b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_d8b4fb7e25e44294ef09697d8fde1987cccdccbfd50c60c382bbebd3b85af81a_v2"}
