Below are the key steps involved in this process:\n1. Setup Initial Baselines: Establish initial performance baselines by evaluating the model on a\ncomprehensive test dataset. Record metrics such as accuracy, latency, throughput, and error rates\nto serve as reference points for future monitoring.\n2. Performance Monitoring: Implement systems to continuously track key performance metrics\nsuch as response time, server load, and token usage. Regularly compare these metrics against the\nestablished baselines to detect any deviations.\n3. Accuracy Monitoring: Continuously evaluate the model’s predictions against a ground truth\ndataset. Use metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, and cross-entropy loss to ensure the model\nmaintains high accuracy levels.\n4. Error Monitoring: Track and analyse errors, including runtime errors and prediction errors.\nImplement logging mechanisms to capture detailed information about each error for troubleshooting\nand improvement.\n5. Log Analysis: Maintain comprehensive logs for each prediction request and response, including\ninput data, output predictions, response times, and encountered errors. Regularly review logs to\nidentify patterns and areas for improvement.\n6. Alerting Mechanisms: Set up automated alerting systems to notify stakeholders of any anomalies\nor deviations from expected performance metrics. Integrate alerts with communication tools like\nSlack, PagerDuty, or email for timely responses.\n7. Feedback Loop: Establish a feedback loop with end-users to gather insights on model performance\nand user satisfaction. Use this feedback to continuously refine and improve the model.\n8. Security Monitoring: Implement robust security measures to monitor for threats, including\nunauthorised access, data breaches, and adversarial attacks. Use encryption, access control, and\nregular security audits to protect the model and data.\n9. Drift Detection: Continuously monitor for data and concept drift using statistical tests and\ndrift detectors. Regularly evaluate the model on holdout datasets to detect changes in input data\ndistribution or model performance.\n10. Model Versioning: Maintain version control for different iterations of the model. Track perfor-\nmance metrics for each version to ensure that the best-performing model is in production.\n72\n11. Documentation and Reporting: Keep detailed documentation of monitoring procedures, met-\nrics, and findings. Generate regular reports to provide stakeholders with insights into the model’s\nperformance and maintenance activities.\n12. Periodic Review and Update: Regularly assess and update the monitoring processes to incor-\nporate new techniques, tools, and best practices, ensuring the monitoring system remains effective\nand up-to-date.\n9.2\nContinuous Monitoring of Model Performance\nWhile large language model (LLM) applications undergo some form of evaluation, continuous monitoring\nremains inadequately implemented in most cases. This section outlines the components necessary to\nestablish an effective monitoring programme aimed at safeguarding users and preserving brand integrity.\n9.2.1\nFunctional Monitoring\nInitially, it is crucial to monitor fundamental metrics consistently. This includes tracking metrics such\nas request volume, response times, token utilisation, costs incurred, and error rates.\n9.2.2\nPrompt Monitoring\nFollowing functional metrics, attention should be directed towards monitoring user-generated prompts\nor inputs. Metrics like readability can provide valuable insights. LLM evaluators should be employed to\ndetect potential toxicity in responses. Additionally, metrics such as embedding distances from reference\nprompts prove insightful, ensuring adaptability to varying user interactions over time.\nIntroducing a new evaluation category involves identifying adversarial attempts or malicious prompt\ninjections, often overlooked in initial evaluations. Comparison against reference sets of known adversarial\nprompts helps identify and flag malicious activities. Evaluative LLMs play a crucial role in classifying\nprompts as benign or malicious.\n9.2.3\nResponse Monitoring\nMonitoring responses involves several critical checks to ensure alignment with expected outcomes. Pa-\nrameters such as relevance, coherence (hallucination), topical alignment, sentiment, and their evolution\nover time are essential. Metrics related to toxicity and harmful output require frequent monitoring due\nto their critical impact. Prompt leakage represents an adversarial tactic wherein sensitive prompt in-\nformation is illicitly extracted from the application’s stored data. Monitoring responses and comparing\nthem against the database of prompt instructions can help detect such breaches. Embedding distance\nmetrics are particularly effective in this regard. Regular testing against evaluation datasets provides\nbenchmarks for accuracy and highlights any performance drift over time. Tools capable of managing\nembeddings allow exportation of underperforming output datasets for targeted improvements.\n9.2.4\nAlerting Mechanisms and Thresholds\nEffective monitoring necessitates well-calibrated alerting thresholds to avoid excessive false alarms. Im-\nplementing multivariate drift detection and alerting mechanisms can enhance accuracy. Consideration\nof false alarm rates and best practices for setting thresholds is paramount for effective monitoring sys-\ntem design. Alerting features should include integration with communication tools such as Slack and\nPagerDuty. Some systems offer automated response blocking in case of alerts triggered by problematic\nprompts. Similar mechanisms can be employed to screen responses for personal identifiable information\n(PII), toxicity, and other quality metrics before delivery to users. Custom metrics tailored to specific\napplication nuances or innovative insights from data scientists can significantly enhance monitoring ef-\nficacy. Flexibility to incorporate such metrics is essential to adapt to evolving monitoring needs and\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama3.2:3b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_e80141fce589fe311b68995cb64141fa3aa0070345e3d6540b63efdced67e837_v2"}
