Building on traditional language models (LMs) like N-gram\nmodels [1], LLMs address limitations such as rare word handling, overfitting, and capturing complex\nlinguistic patterns. Notable examples, such as GPT-3 and GPT-4 [2], leverage the self-attention mecha-\nnism within Transformer architectures to efficiently manage sequential data and understand long-range\ndependencies. Key advancements include in-context learning for generating coherent text from prompts\nand Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) [3] for refining models using human re-\nsponses. Techniques like prompt engineering, question-answering, and conversational interactions have\nsignificantly advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP) [4].\n1.2\nHistorical Development and Key Milestones\nLanguage models are fundamental to natural language processing (NLP), leveraging mathematical tech-\nniques to generalise linguistic rules and knowledge for tasks involving prediction and generation. Over\nseveral decades, language modelling has evolved from early statistical language models (SLMs) to to-\nday’s advanced large language models (LLMs). This rapid advancement has enabled LLMs to process,\ncomprehend, and generate text at a level comparable to human capabilities [5, 6].\nFigure 1.1 shows the evolution of large language models from early statistical approaches to current\nadvanced models.\n1.3\nEvolution from Traditional NLP Models to State-of-the-Art\nLLMs\nUnderstanding LLMs requires tracing the development of language models through stages such as Statis-\ntical Language Models (SLMs), Neural Language Models (NLMs), Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs),\nand LLMs.\n1.3.1\nStatistical Language Models (SLMs)\nEmerging in the 1990s, SLMs analyse natural language using probabilistic methods to determine the\nlikelihood of sentences within texts.\nFor instance, the probability P(S) of the sentence “I am very\nhappy” is given by:\nP(S) = P(ω1, ω2, ω3, ω4) = P(I, am, very, happy)\n(1.1)\nThis probability can be calculated using conditional probabilities:\nP(I, am, very, happy) = P(I) · P(am | I) · P(very | I, am) · P(happy | I, am, very)\n(1.2)\nConditional probabilities are estimated using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE):\n6\nFigure 1.1: A chronological timeline showcasing the evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) from\n1990 to 2023. This progression begins with early statistical models such as N-grams, transitions through\nneural language models like Word2Vec and RNN/LSTM, and advances into the era of pre-trained mod-\nels with the introduction of transformers and attention mechanisms. The figure highlights significant\nmilestones, including the development of BERT, GPT series, and recent innovations such as GPT-4 and\nChatGPT, demonstrating the rapid advancements in LLM technology over time.

Word vectors\nenable computers to understand word meanings. Tools like Word2Vec [7] represent words in a vector\nspace where semantic relationships are reflected in vector angles. NLMs consist of interconnected neurons\norganised into layers, resembling the human brain’s structure. The input layer concatenates word vectors,\nthe hidden layer applies a non-linear activation function, and the output layer predicts subsequent words\nusing the Softmax function to transform values into a probability distribution.\nFigure 1.2 illustrates the structure of Neural Language Models, highlighting the layers and connections\nused to predict subsequent words.\n1.3.3\nPre-trained Language Models (PLMs)\nPLMs are initially trained on extensive volumes of unlabelled text to understand fundamental language\nstructures (pre-training). They are then fine-tuned on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This ”pre-training\nand fine-tuning” paradigm, exemplified by GPT-2 [8] and BERT [9], has led to diverse and effective model\narchitectures.\n1.3.4\nLarge Language Models (LLMs)\nLLMs like GPT-3, GPT-4, PaLM [10], and LLaMA [11] are trained on massive text corpora with tens of\nbillions of parameters. LLMs undergo a two-stage process: initial pre-training on a vast corpus followed\n7\nFigure 1.2: A schematic representation of Neural Language Models, showcasing the layered architecture\nwhere the input layer processes sequential data, the hidden layer captures dependencies, and the output\nlayer generates predictions. The figure emphasises the flow of information through concatenation and\nmatrix multiplications, culminating in a probability distribution via the softmax function. (adopted from\n[6])\nby alignment with human values. This approach enables LLMs to understand human commands and\nvalues better.\n1.4\nOverview of Current Leading LLMs\nLLMs are powerful tools in NLP, capable of performing tasks such as translation, summarisation, and\nconversational interaction.
