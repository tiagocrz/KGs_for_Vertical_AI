Introduction
1.1
Background of Large Language Models (LLMs)
Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a significant leap in computational systems capable of under-
standing and generating human language. Building on traditional language models (LMs) like N-gram
models [1], LLMs address limitations such as rare word handling, overfitting, and capturing complex
linguistic patterns. Notable examples, such as GPT-3 and GPT-4 [2], leverage the self-attention mecha-
nism within Transformer architectures to efficiently manage sequential data and understand long-range
dependencies. Key advancements include in-context learning for generating coherent text from prompts
and Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) [3] for refining models using human re-
sponses. Techniques like prompt engineering, question-answering, and conversational interactions have
significantly advanced the field of natural language processing (NLP) [4].
1.2
Historical Development and Key Milestones
Language models are fundamental to natural language processing (NLP), leveraging mathematical tech-
niques to generalise linguistic rules and knowledge for tasks involving prediction and generation. Over
several decades, language modelling has evolved from early statistical language models (SLMs) to to-
day’s advanced large language models (LLMs). This rapid advancement has enabled LLMs to process,
comprehend, and generate text at a level comparable to human capabilities [5, 6].
Figure 1.1 shows the evolution of large language models from early statistical approaches to current
advanced models.

Evolution from Traditional NLP Models to State-of-the-Art
LLMs
Understanding LLMs requires tracing the development of language models through stages such as Statis-
tical Language Models (SLMs), Neural Language Models (NLMs), Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs),
and LLMs.
1.3.1
Statistical Language Models (SLMs)
Emerging in the 1990s, SLMs analyse natural language using probabilistic methods to determine the
likelihood of sentences within texts.
For instance, the probability P(S) of the sentence “I am very
happy” is given by:
P(S) = P(ω1, ω2, ω3, ω4) = P(I, am, very, happy)
(1.1)
This probability can be calculated using conditional probabilities:
P(I, am, very, happy) = P(I) · P(am | I) · P(very | I, am) · P(happy | I, am, very)
(1.2)
Conditional probabilities are estimated using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE):

1990 to 2023. This progression begins with early statistical models such as N-grams, transitions through
neural language models like Word2Vec and RNN/LSTM, and advances into the era of pre-trained mod-
els with the introduction of transformers and attention mechanisms. The figure highlights significant
milestones, including the development of BERT, GPT series, and recent innovations such as GPT-4 and
ChatGPT, demonstrating the rapid advancements in LLM technology over time. (adapted from [6])

1.3.2
Neural Language Models (NLMs)
NLMs leverage neural networks to predict word sequences, overcoming SLM limitations. Word vectors
enable computers to understand word meanings. Tools like Word2Vec [7] represent words in a vector
space where semantic relationships are reflected in vector angles. NLMs consist of interconnected neurons
organised into layers, resembling the human brain’s structure. The input layer concatenates word vectors,
the hidden layer applies a non-linear activation function, and the output layer predicts subsequent words
using the Softmax function to transform values into a probability distribution.
Figure 1.2 illustrates the structure of Neural Language Models, highlighting the layers and connections
used to predict subsequent words.
1.3.3
Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs)
PLMs are initially trained on extensive volumes of unlabelled text to understand fundamental language
structures (pre-training). They are then fine-tuned on a smaller, task-specific dataset. This ”pre-training
and fine-tuning” paradigm, exemplified by GPT-2 [8] and BERT [9], has led to diverse and effective model
architectures.
1.3.4
Large Language Models (LLMs)
LLMs like GPT-3, GPT-4, PaLM [10], and LLaMA [11] are trained on massive text corpora with tens of
billions of parameters. LLMs undergo a two-stage process: initial pre-training on a vast corpus followed

layer generates predictions. The figure emphasises the flow of information through concatenation and
matrix multiplications, culminating in a probability distribution via the softmax function. (adopted from

by alignment with human values. This approach enables LLMs to understand human commands and
values better.
1.4
Overview of Current Leading LLMs
LLMs are powerful tools in NLP, capable of performing tasks such as translation, summarisation, and
conversational interaction. Advances in transformer architectures, computational power, and extensive
datasets have driven their success. These models approximate human-level performance, making them
invaluable for research and practical implementations. LLMs’ rapid development has spurred research
into architectural innovations, training strategies, extending context lengths, fine-tuning techniques, and
integrating multi-modal data. Their applications extend beyond NLP, aiding in human-robot interactions
and creating intuitive AI systems. This highlights the importance of comprehensive reviews consolidating
the latest developments [12].
Figure 1.3 provides an overview of current leading LLMs, highlighting their capabilities and applications.
1.5
What is Fine-Tuning?
Fine-tuning uses a pre-trained model, such as OpenAI’s GPT series, as a foundation.
The process
involves further training on a smaller, domain-specific dataset. This approach builds upon the model’s
pre-existing knowledge, enhancing performance on specific tasks with reduced data and computational
requirements.
Fine-tuning transfers the pre-trained model’s learned patterns and features to new tasks, improving
performance and reducing training data needs. It has become popular in NLP for tasks like text classi-
fication, sentiment analysis, and question-answering.

mains. Each dimension is linked to specific techniques, challenges, and examples of models that exemplify
the discussed characteristics. This diagram serves as an overview of the multifaceted considerations in
the development and deployment of LLMs. (adapted from [13])
1.6
Types of LLM Fine-Tuning
1.6.1
Unsupervised Fine-Tuning
This method does not require labelled data. Instead, the LLM is exposed to a large corpus of unla-
belled text from the target domain, refining its understanding of language. This approach is useful for
new domains like legal or medical fields but is less precise for specific tasks such as classification or
summarisation.
1.6.2
Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
SFT involves providing the LLM with labelled data tailored to the target task. For example, fine-tuning
an LLM for text classification in a business context uses a dataset of text snippets with class labels.
While effective, this method requires substantial labelled data, which can be costly and time-consuming
to obtain.
9
1.6.3
Instruction Fine-Tuning via Prompt Engineering
This method relies on providing the LLM with natural language instructions, useful for creating spe-
cialised assistants. It reduces the need for vast amounts of labelled data but depends heavily on the
quality of the prompts.

The table outlines key differences between the pre-training and fine-tuning phases across various aspects
such as definition, data requirements, objectives, processes, model modification, computational costs,
training duration, and their respective purposes, with examples highlighting specific models and tasks.
Pre-training involves extensive training on vast amounts of unlabelled data to build general linguistic
knowledge, while fine-tuning adapts the pre-trained models to specialised tasks using smaller, labelled
datasets, focusing on task-specific performance improvements.
1.8
Importance of Fine-Tuning LLMs
1. Transfer Learning: Fine-tuning leverages the knowledge acquired during pre-training, adapting
it to specific tasks with reduced computation time and resources.
2. Reduced Data Requirements: Fine-tuning requires less labelled data, focusing on tailoring
pre-trained features to the target task.
3. Improved Generalisation: Fine-tuning enhances the model’s ability to generalise to specific
tasks or domains, capturing general language features and customising them.
4. Efficient Model Deployment: Fine-tuned models are more efficient for real-world applications,
being computationally efficient and well-suited for specific tasks.
5. Adaptability to Various Tasks: Fine-tuned LLMs can adapt to a broad range of tasks, per-
forming well across various applications without task-specific architectures.
6. Domain-Specific Performance: Fine-tuning allows models to excel in domain-specific tasks by
adjusting to the nuances and vocabulary of the target domain.
10
7. Faster Convergence: Fine-tuning usually achieves faster convergence, starting with weights that
already capture general language features.
1.9
Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
A popular method to utilise your own data is by incorporating it into the prompt when querying the LLM
model. This approach, known as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), involves retrieving relevant
data and using it as additional context for the LLM. Instead of depending solely on knowledge from the
training data, a RAG workflow pulls pertinent information, connecting static LLMs with real-time data
retrieval. With RAG architecture, organisations can deploy any LLM model and enhance it to return
relevant results by providing a small amount of their own data (see Figure1.4 for visual workflow). This
process avoids the costs and time associated with fine-tuning or pre-training the model.
Figure 1.4: An illustration of the Traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline steps,
depicting the sequential process from client query to response generation.
The pipeline starts with
the client’s question, followed by semantic search in a vector database, contextually enriching the data
before generating a prompt for the large language model (LLM). The final response is post-processed
and returned to the client.
1.9.1
Traditional RAG Pipeline and Steps
1. Data Indexing: Organise data efficiently for quick retrieval. This involves processing, chunking,
and storing data in a vector database using indexing strategies like search indexing, vector indexing,
and hybrid indexing.
2. Input Query Processing: Refine user queries to improve compatibility with indexed data. This
can include simplification or vector transformation of queries for enhanced search efficiency.
3. Searching and Ranking: Retrieve and rank data based on relevance using search algorithms
such as TF-IDF, BM25, and deep learning models like BERT to interpret the query’s intent and
context.
4. Prompt Augmentation: Incorporate relevant information from the search results into the origi-
nal query to provide the LLM with additional context, enhancing response accuracy and relevance.
11
5. Response Generation: Use the augmented prompt to generate responses that combine the LLM’s
knowledge with current, specific data, ensuring high-quality, contextually grounded answers.
1.9.2
Benefits of Using RAG
• Up-to-Date and Accurate Responses: Enhances the LLM’s responses with current external
data, improving accuracy and relevance.
• Reducing Inaccurate Responses: Grounds the LLM’s output in relevant knowledge, reducing
the risk of generating incorrect information.
• Domain-Specific Responses: Delivers contextually relevant responses tailored to an organisa-
tion’s proprietary data.
• Efficiency and Cost-Effectiveness: Offers a cost-effective method for customising LLMs without
extensive model fine-tuning.
1.9.3
Challenges and Considerations in Serving RAG
1. User Experience: Ensuring rapid response times suitable for real-time applications.
2. Cost Efficiency: Managing the costs associated with serving millions of responses.
3. Accuracy: Ensuring outputs are accurate to avoid misinformation.
4. Recency and Relevance: Keeping responses and content current with the latest data.
5. Business Context Awareness: Aligning LLM responses with specific business contexts.
6. Service Scalability: Managing increased capacity while controlling costs.
7. Security and Governance: Implementing protocols for data security, privacy, and governance.
1.9.4
Use Cases and Examples
1. Question and Answer Chatbots: Integrate LLMs with chatbots to generate accurate answers
from company documents, enhancing customer support.
2. Search Augmentation: Enhance search engines with LLM-generated answers for more accurate
informational queries.
3. Knowledge Engine: Use LLMs to answer questions related to internal functions, such as HR
and compliance, using company data.
1.9.5
Considerations for Choosing Between RAG and Fine-Tuning
When considering external data access, RAG is likely a superior option for applications needing to access
external data sources. Fine-tuning, on the other hand, is more suitable if you require the model to ad-
just its behaviour, and writing style, or incorporate domain-specific knowledge. In terms of suppressing
hallucinations and ensuring accuracy, RAG systems tend to perform better as they are less prone to gen-
erating incorrect information. If you have ample domain-specific, labelled training data, fine-tuning can
result in a more tailored model behaviour, whereas RAG systems are robust alternatives when such data
is scarce. RAG systems provide an advantage with dynamic data retrieval capabilities for environments
where data frequently updates or changes. Additionally, it is crucial to ensure the transparency and
interpret ability of the model’s decision-making process. In that case, RAG systems offer insight that is
typically not available in models that are solely fine-tuned. Figure1.5 illustrates the visual representation
alongside example use cases.

Chapter 2
Seven Stage Fine-Tuning Pipeline
for LLM
Fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) is a comprehensive process divided into seven distinct
stages, each essential for adapting the pre-trained model to specific tasks and ensuring optimal per-
formance. These stages encompass everything from initial dataset preparation to the final deployment
and maintenance of the fine-tuned model. By following these stages systematically, the model is refined
and tailored to meet precise requirements, ultimately enhancing its ability to generate accurate and
contextually appropriate responses. The seven stages include Dataset Preparation, Model Initialisation,
Training Environment Setup, Fine-Tuning, Evaluation and Validation, Deployment, and Monitoring and
Maintenance.
Figure 2.1 illustrates the comprehensive pipeline for fine-tuning LLMs, encompassing all necessary stages
from dataset preparation to monitoring and maintenance.
2.1
Stage 1: Dataset Preparation
Fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) starts with adapting the pre-trained model for specific tasks
by updating its parameters using a new dataset. This involves cleaning and formatting the dataset to
match the target task, such as instruction tuning, sentiment analysis, or topic mapping. The dataset is
composed of < input, output > pairs, demonstrating the desired behaviour for the model.
For example, in instruction tuning, the dataset may look like:
###Human: $<Input Query>$
###Assistant: $<Generated Output>$
Here, the ’Input Query’ is what the user asks, and the ’Generated Output’ is the model’s response. The
structure and style of these pairs can be adjusted based on the specific needs of the task.
2.2
Stage 2: Model Initialisation
Model initialisation is the process of setting up the initial parameters and configurations of the LLM
before training or deploying it. This step is crucial for ensuring the model performs optimally, trains
efficiently, and avoids issues such as vanishing or exploding gradients.
2.3
Stage 3: Training Environment Setup
Setting up the training environment for LLM fine-tuning involves configuring the necessary infrastructure
to adapt a pre-existing model for specific tasks. This includes selecting relevant training data, defining the
model’s architecture and hyperparameters, and running training iterations to adjust the model’s weights
and biases.
The aim is to enhance the LLM’s performance in generating accurate and contextually
appropriate outputs tailored to specific applications, like content creation, translation, or sentiment
analysis. Successful fine-tuning relies on careful preparation and rigorous experimentation.
14
Figure 2.1: A comprehensive pipeline for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), illustrating the
seven essential stages: Dataset Preparation, Model Initialisation, Training Environment Setup, Fine-
Tuning, Evaluation and Validation, Deployment, and Monitoring and Maintenance. Each stage plays
a crucial role in adapting the pre-trained model to specific tasks and ensuring optimal performance
throughout its lifecycle.
2.4
Stage 4: Partial or Full Fine-Tuning
This stage involves updating the parameters of the LLM using a task-specific dataset. Full fine-tuning up-
dates all parameters of the model, ensuring comprehensive adaptation to the new task. Alternatively, Half
fine-tuning (HFT) [15] or Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approaches, such as using adapter
layers, can be employed to partially fine-tune the model. This method attaches additional layers to the
pre-trained model, allowing for efficient fine-tuning with fewer parameters, which can address challenges
related to computational efficiency, overfitting, and optimisation.
2.5
Stage 5: Evaluation and Validation
Evaluation and validation involve assessing the fine-tuned LLM’s performance on unseen data to ensure
it generalises well and meets the desired objectives. Evaluation metrics, such as cross-entropy, measure
prediction errors, while validation monitors loss curves and other performance indicators to detect issues
like overfitting or underfitting.
This stage helps guide further fine-tuning to achieve optimal model
performance.
15
2.6
Stage 6: Deployment
Deploying an LLM means making it operational and accessible for specific applications. This involves
configuring the model to run efficiently on designated hardware or software platforms, ensuring it can
handle tasks like natural language processing, text generation, or user query understanding. Deployment
also includes setting up integration, security measures, and monitoring systems to ensure reliable and
secure performance in real-world applications.
2.7
Stage 7: Monitoring and Maintenance
Monitoring and maintaining an LLM after deployment is crucial to ensure ongoing performance and
reliability.
This involves continuously tracking the model’s performance, addressing any issues that
arise, and updating the model as needed to adapt to new data or changing requirements.
Effective
monitoring and maintenance help sustain the model’s accuracy and effectiveness over time.

3.2
Existing and Potential Research Methodologies
3.2.1
Data Annotation
Data annotation involves labelling or tagging textual data with specific attributes relevant to the model’s
training objectives.
This process is crucial for supervised learning tasks and greatly influences the
performance of the fine-tuned model. Recent research highlights various approaches to data annotation:
• Human Annotation: Manual annotation by human experts remains a gold standard due to its
accuracy and context understanding. However, it is time-consuming and costly for large datasets
[16]. Tools like Excel, Prodigy1, and Innodata2 facilitate this process.
• Semi-automatic Annotation: Combining machine learning algorithms with human review to
create labelled datasets more efficiently. This approach balances efficiency and accuracy. Tools
like Snorkel3 use weak supervision to generate initial labels, which are then refined by human
annotators [17].

2https://innodata.com/
3https://snorkel.ai/
19
• Automatic Annotation: Fully automated annotation leverages machine learning algorithms to
label data without human intervention, offering scalability and cost-effectiveness.
Services like
Amazon SageMaker Ground Truth4 utilise machine learning to automate data labelling, al-
though the accuracy may vary depending on the complexity of the task [18].
3.2.2
Data Augmentation
Data Augmentation (DA) techniques expand training datasets artificially to address data scarcity and
improve model performance. Advanced techniques often used in NLP include:
• Word Embeddings: Using word embeddings like Word2Vec and GloVe to replace words with
their semantic equivalents, thereby generating new data instances [19, 20].
• Back Translation: Translating text to another language and then back to the original language
to create paraphrased data. This technique helps in generating diverse training samples [21]. Tools
like Google Translate API5 are commonly used for this purpose.
• Adversarial Attacks: Generating augmented data through adversarial examples that slightly
modify the original text to create new training samples while preserving the original meaning [22].
Libraries like TextAttack6 provide frameworks for such augmentations.
• NLP-AUG7: This library offers a variety of augmenters for character, word, sentence, audio, and
spectrogram augmentation, enhancing dataset diversity.
3.2.3
Synthetic Data Generation using LLMs
Large Language Models (LLMs) can generate synthetic data through innovative techniques such as:
• Prompt Engineering: Crafting specific prompts to guide LLMs like GPT-3 in generating relevant
and high-quality synthetic data [23].
• Multi-Step Generation: Employing iterative generation processes where LLMs generate initial
data that is refined through subsequent steps [24]. This method can produce high-quality synthetic
data for various tasks, including summarising and bias detection.
It is crucial to verify the accuracy and relevance of synthetic data generated by LLMs before using
them for fine-tuning processes [25].
3.3
Challenges in Data Preparation for Fine-Tuning LLMs
Key challenges in data preparation include:
1. Domain Relevance: Ensuring that the data is relevant to the specific domain for accurate model
performance. Mismatched domain data can lead to poor generalisation and inaccurate outputs
[26].
2. Data Diversity: Including diverse and well-balanced data to prevent model biases and improve
generalisation. A lack of diversity can cause the model to perform poorly on underrepresented
scenarios [27].
3. Data Size: Managing and processing large datasets, with at least 1000 samples recommended for
effective fine-tuning. However, large datasets pose challenges in terms of storage, computational
requirements, and processing time.
4. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Removing noise, errors, and inconsistencies are critical for
providing clean inputs to the model. Poorly preprocessed data can degrade model performance
significantly.

5. Data Annotation: Ensuring precise and consistent labelling is essential for tasks requiring la-
belled data. Inconsistent annotation can lead to unreliable model predictions.
6. Handling Rare Cases: Adequately representing rare but important instances in the dataset to
ensure the model can generalise to less frequent but critical scenarios.
7. Ethical Considerations: Scrutinising data for harmful or biased content to prevent unintended

process from setting up the environment to executing tasks. Each step is critical for ensuring that the
LLM is correctly configured and ready for operation. This includes installing necessary dependencies,
importing libraries, selecting and downloading the appropriate language model from a repository, and
finally, loading the model to perform specific tasks.
1. Set Up the Environment: Configure your environment, such as setting up GPU/TPU usage if
available, which can significantly speed up model loading and inference.
2. Install the Dependencies: Ensure that all necessary software and libraries are installed. This
typically includes package managers like pip and frameworks like PyTorch or TensorFlow.
22
3. Import the Libraries: Import the required libraries in your script or notebook. Common libraries
include transformers from Hugging Face, torch for PyTorch, and other utility libraries.
4. Choose the Language Model: Select the appropriate pre-trained language model based on your
task requirements. This could be models like BERT, GPT-3, or others available on platforms like
Hugging Face’s Model Hub.
5. Download the Model from the Repository: Use the chosen framework’s functions to download
the pre-trained model from an online repository. For instance, using transformers, you might use
AutoModel.from pretrained(’model name’).
6. Load the Model in the Memory: Load the model into memory, ready for inference or further
fine-tuning. This step ensures the model weights are initialised and ready for use.
7. Execute Tasks: Perform the desired tasks using the loaded model. This could involve making
predictions, generating text, or fine-tuning the model on a new dataset.
4.2
Tools and Libraries for Model Initialisation
Python offers a wide range of libraries for Initialising large language models, providing access to both
open and closed-source models. Here are some notable libraries:
1. Python Library: HuggingFace
Description: HuggingFace is renowned for its support of numerous pre-trained large language
models, ranging from Phi-3 mini to Llama-3 70B. The transformers library, part of HuggingFace,
enables users to access these models via classes such as AutoModelForCausalLM. This library
supports loading fine-tuned models as well as 4-bit quantised models. Additionally, the transformers
library includes the ”pipeline” feature, making it easy to use pre-trained models for various tasks
[35].
2. Python Framework: PyTorch
Description: PyTorch offers comprehensive tools and libraries for Initialising and fine-tuning
large language models. It provides a flexible and efficient platform for building and deploying deep
learning models. HuggingFace’s transformers library bridges the gap between PyTorch and other
frameworks, enhancing its usability for state-of-the-art language models [36].
3. Python Framework: TensorFlow
Description: TensorFlow also provides extensive tools and libraries for Initialising and fine-tuning
large language models. Similar to PyTorch, it benefits from the HuggingFace transformers library,
which provides a versatile and user-friendly API and interface for working with the latest advance-
ments in large language models [37].
23
4.3
Challenges in Model Initialisation
Challenge
Description
Alignment with the
Target Task
It’s essential that the pre-trained model closely aligns with your specific
task or domain. This initial alignment serves as a solid foundation for
further fine-tuning efforts, leading to improved efficiency and results [38].
Understanding the
Pre-trained Model
Before making a selection, it’s crucial to thoroughly comprehend the
architecture, capabilities, limitations, and the tasks the model was orig-
inally trained on. Without this understanding, fine-tuning efforts may
not yield the desired outcomes [23].
Availability and
Compatibility
Careful consideration of a model’s documentation, license, maintenance,
and update frequency is necessary to avoid potential issues and ensure
smooth integration into your application.
Model Architecture
Not all models excel at every task.
Each model architecture has its
strengths and weaknesses, so selecting one aligned with your specific
task is essential for favourable outcomes [39].
Resource Constraints
Loading pre-trained LLMs is resource-heavy and requires more compu-
tation. These models need high-performance CPUs and GPUs and a
significant amount of disk space. For instance, the Llama 3 8B model
requires a minimum of 16GB of memory to load and run the inference.
Privacy
Privacy and confidentiality are crucial factors when selecting a large lan-
guage model (LLM). Many businesses prefer not to share their data
with external LLM providers.
In such instances, hosting an LLM on
local servers or using pre-trained LLMs available through private cloud
providers can be viable solutions. These approaches ensure that data
remains within the company’s premises, thereby preserving privacy and
confidentiality.
Cost and Maintenance
Hosting LLMs on local servers entails significant time and expense for
setup and ongoing maintenance. Conversely, utilising cloud vendors al-
leviates concerns about resource maintenance but incurs monthly billing
costs. These charges are typically based on factors such as model size
and the volume of requests per minute.
Model Size and
Quantisation
utilising a pre-trained model with high memory consumption can still be
viable by employing its quantised version. Through quantisation, pre-
trained weights can be loaded with reduced precision, typically 4-bit or
8-bit floating point, substantially diminishing parameter volume while
maintaining considerable accuracy [40].
Pre-training Datasets
Examine the datasets used for pre-training to gauge the model’s under-
standing of language. These are important as there are models available
specifically for performing code generation, and we do not want to use
those models for finance text classification [41].
Bias Awareness
Be vigilant regarding potential biases in pre-trained models, especially if
unbiased predictions are required. The bias awareness can be evaluated
by testing different models and backtracking the datasets used for pre-
training [42].
Table 4.1: Comprehensive Overview of Challenges in Initialising a Large Language Model (LLM). This
table highlights critical considerations, such as the importance of aligning pre-trained models with specific
tasks, understanding model architecture and compatibility, managing resource constraints, and ensuring
data privacy. Additionally, it discusses the challenges related to cost, maintenance, and the complexities
of model size, quantisation, and bias awareness. Each challenge is associated with specific references to
ensure thorough understanding and proper model deployment.

Stage 3: Training Setup
5.1
Steps Involved in Training Setup
1. Setting up the training environment: When setting up the environment for training an LLM,
it is crucial to configure high-performance hardware, such as GPUs or TPUs, and ensure proper
installation of necessary software components like CUDA, cuDNN, and deep learning frameworks
such as PyTorch or TensorFlow. Verify hardware recognition and compatibility with the software to
leverage computational power effectively, reducing training time and improving model performance.
2. Defining the Hyper-parameters: When defining hyperparameters for fine-tuning an LLM, it is
essential to carefully tune key parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and epochs to optimise
the model’s performance.
3. Initialising Optimisers and Loss Functions: When initialising optimisers and loss functions
for fine-tuning an LLM, it is crucial to select the appropriate optimiser to efficiently update the
model’s weights and the correct loss function to measure model performance [43].
5.2
Setting up Training Environment
When fine-tuning a large language model (LLM), the computational environment plays a crucial role in
ensuring efficient training. To achieve optimal performance, it’s essential to configure the environment
with high-performance hardware such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) or TPUs (Tensor Processing
Units). GPUs, such as the NVIDIA A100 or V100, are widely used for training deep learning models
due to their parallel processing capabilities. For larger-scale operations, TPUs offered by Google Cloud
can provide even greater acceleration [44].
First, ensure that your system or cloud environment has the necessary hardware installed. For GPUs,
this involves setting up CUDA1 (Compute Unified Device Architecture) and cuDNN2 (CUDA Deep Neu-
ral Network library) from NVIDIA, which are essential for enabling GPU acceleration. For TPU usage,
you would typically set up a Google Cloud environment with TPU instances, which includes configuring
the TPU runtime in your training scripts.
Verify that your hardware is correctly recognised and utilised by your deep learning frameworks. In
PyTorch, for instance, you can check GPU availability with torch.cuda.is available(). Properly setting
up and testing the hardware ensures that the training process can leverage the computational power
effectively, reducing training time and improving model performance [36].
When fine-tuning an LLM, both software and hardware considerations are paramount to ensure a smooth
and efficient training process. On the software side, you need a compatible deep learning framework like
PyTorch or TensorFlow. These frameworks have extensive support for LLMs and provide utilities for
efficient model training and evaluation. Installing the latest versions of these frameworks, along with
any necessary dependencies, is crucial for leveraging the latest features and performance improvements
1https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit
2https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn
26
[45].
Additionally, use libraries like Hugging Face’s transformers to simplify the process of loading pre-trained
models and tokenizers. This library is particularly well-suited for working with various LLMs and offers
a user-friendly interface for model fine-tuning. Ensure that all software components, including libraries
and dependencies, are compatible with your chosen framework and hardware setup [35].
On the hardware side, consider the memory requirements of the model and your dataset. LLMs typ-
ically require substantial GPU memory, so opting for GPUs with higher VRAM (e.g., 16GB or more)
can be beneficial. If your model is exceptionally large or if you are training with very large datasets,
distributed training across multiple GPUs or TPUs might be necessary. This requires a careful setup of
data parallelism or model parallelism techniques to efficiently utilise the available hardware [46].
Lastly, ensure robust cooling and power supply for your hardware, as training LLMs can be resource-
intensive, generating significant heat and requiring consistent power. Proper hardware setup not only
enhances training performance but also prolongs the lifespan of your equipment [47].
5.3
Defining Hyperparameters
Key hyperparameters like learning rate, batch size, epochs are crucial for enhancing the model’s perfor-
mance and obtaining superior outcomes. This process entails adjusting hyperparameters and training
settings to align with your particular use case. Below are the key hyperparameters:
1. Learning Rate: Fine-tuning an LLM involves using optimisation algorithms like stochastic gradi-
ent descent (SGD). This technique estimates the error gradient for the model’s current state using
samples from the training dataset and subsequently updates the model’s weights via the backprop-
agation of errors algorithm. The learning rate dictates the speed at which the model adapts to the
problem. Smaller learning rates necessitate more training due to the minimal weight adjustments
per update, while larger learning rates lead to quicker changes to weights [48].
2. Batch Size: A batch refers to a subset of the training data used to update a model’s weights
during the training process. Batch training involves dividing the entire training set into smaller
groups, updating the model after processing each batch. The batch size is a hyperparameter that
determines the number of samples processed before the model parameters are updated.
3. Epochs: Epoch refers to a full pass through the entire training dataset. This involves a complete
forward and backward pass through the dataset. The dataset can be processed as a single batch
or divided into multiple smaller batches. An epoch is considered complete once the model has
processed all batches and updated its parameters based on the calculated loss.
5.3.1
Methods for Hyperparameter Tuning
LLM hyperparameter tuning involves adjusting various hyperparameters during the training process
to identify the optimal combination that yields the best output. This process often entails significant
trial and error, meticulously tracking each hyperparameter adjustment, and recording the resulting
performance. Conducting this manually can be highly time-consuming. To address this, automated
hyperparameter tuning methods have been developed to streamline the process. The three most common
methods of automated hyperparameter tuning are random search, grid search, and Bayesian optimisation:
1. Random Search: This method randomly selects and evaluates combinations of hyperparameters
from a specified range. It is a straightforward and efficient approach capable of exploring a large
parameter space. However, it may not always find the optimal combination of hyperparameters
and can be computationally expensive [49].
2. Grid Search: Unlike random search, grid search exhaustively evaluates every possible combination
of hyperparameters from a given range.
Although resource-intensive, this systematic approach
ensures that the optimal set of hyperparameters is found [50].
27
3. Bayesian Optimisation: This method uses a probabilistic model to predict the performance of
different hyperparameters and selects the best ones accordingly. It is an efficient method that can
handle large parameter spaces better and is less resource-intensive than grid search. However, it is
more complex to set up and may be less reliable in identifying the optimal set of hyperparameters
compared to grid search.
4. Automated hyperparameter tuning: This facilitates the development of multiple language
models, each with a unique combination of hyperparameters. By training these models on the same
dataset, it becomes possible to compare their outputs and determine which configuration is best
suited for the desired use case. Additionally, models tuned with different sets of hyperparameters
can be tailored to various specific applications.
5.4
Initialising Optimisers and Loss Functions
Choosing the right optimiser and loss function is crucial for training and fine-tuning LLMs.
Below
are descriptions of some commonly used optimisation algorithms, their advantages, disadvantages, and
appropriate use cases:
5.4.1
Gradient Descent
Gradient Descent is a fundamental optimisation algorithm used to minimise cost functions in machine
learning models. It aims to find the optimal parameters for a neural network.
How it Works: Gradient Descent iteratively updates model parameters in the direction of the
negative gradient of the cost function. It calculates gradients for each parameter and applies updates
across all data points until convergence. This method utilises the entire dataset to calculate gradients,
often requiring a fixed learning rate and being sensitive to the scale of data and learning rate choice.
Pros:
• Simple and easy to implement.
• Intuitive and easy to understand.
• Converges to the global minimum for convex functions.
• Suitable for small-scale problems.
Cons:
• Computationally expensive on large datasets.
• May get stuck in local minima.
• Requires a large number of iterations.
• Sensitive to the choice of learning rate.
When to Use: Gradient Descent is best used for small datasets where gradient computation is
cheap and simplicity and clarity are preferred.
5.4.2
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)
Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a variant of Gradient Descent that focuses on reducing computation
per iteration.
How it Works: SGD updates parameters using a single or few data points at each iteration, intro-
ducing randomness in updates. It reduces the computational burden per iteration and often converges
faster than batch Gradient Descent. However, it requires a smaller learning rate due to higher variance
and benefits from momentum to stabilise updates.
Pros:
• Fast and handles large datasets well.
• Efficient memory usage.
28
• Simple and easy to implement.
• Can escape local minima due to noise.
Cons:
• High variance in updates can lead to instability.
• Can overshoot the minimum.
• Sensitive to the choice of learning rate.
• Can be slower to converge compared to batch methods.
When to Use: SGD is ideal for large datasets, incremental learning scenarios, and real-time learning
environments where computational resources are limited.
5.4.3
Mini-batch Gradient Descent
Mini-batch Gradient Descent combines the efficiency of SGD and the stability of batch Gradient Descent,
offering a compromise between batch and stochastic approaches.
How it Works: It splits data into small batches and updates parameters using gradients averaged
over each mini-batch. This reduces variance compared to SGD and is more efficient than batch Gradient
Descent, helping in generalising the updates.
Pros:
• Balances between efficiency and stability.
• More generalisable updates.
• Reduces the variance of parameter updates.
• Provides a compromise between SGD and batch.
Cons:
• Requires tuning of batch size.
• Can still be computationally expensive for very large datasets.
• More complex implementation.
• Can require more iterations than full-batch Gradient Descent.
When to Use: Mini-batch Gradient Descent is suitable for most deep learning tasks, especially
when working with moderate to large datasets.
5.4.4
AdaGrad
Adaptive Gradient Algorithm (AdaGrad) is designed for sparse data and high-dimensional models, ad-
justing learning rates to improve performance on sparse data.
How it Works: AdaGrad adapts the learning rate for each parameter based on historical gradi-
ent information, accumulating squared gradients. This approach prevents large updates for frequent
parameters and helps in dealing with sparse features.
Pros:
• Adapts learning rate for each parameter.
• Good for sparse data.
• No need to manually tune learning rates.
• Works well with high-dimensional data.
Cons:
• Learning rate can diminish to zero, stopping learning.
29
• May require more tuning for convergence.
• Accumulation of squared gradients can lead to overly small learning rates.
• Can slow down significantly.
When to Use: AdaGrad is useful for sparse datasets like text and images where learning rates need
to adapt to feature frequency.
5.4.5
RMSprop
Root Mean Square Propagation (RMSprop) is an adaptive learning rate method designed to perform
better on non-stationary and online problems.
How it Works: RMSprop modifies AdaGrad by using a moving average of squared gradients to
adapt learning rates based on recent gradient magnitudes. It maintains a running average of squared
gradients to help in maintaining steady learning rates.
Pros:
• Addresses the diminishing learning rate problem of AdaGrad.
• Adapts learning rate based on recent gradients.
• Effective for recurrent neural networks.
• More robust against non-stationary targets.
Cons:
• Can still get stuck in local minima on non-convex problems.
• Requires hyperparameter tuning.
• Requires careful tuning of the decay rate.
• Can be sensitive to the initial learning rate.
When to Use: RMSprop is best for non-convex optimisation problems, training RNNs and LSTMs,
and dealing with noisy or non-stationary objectives.
5.4.6
AdaDelta
Adaptive Delta (AdaDelta) improves on AdaGrad and RMSprop, focusing on adaptive learning rates
without diminishing too quickly.
How it Works: AdaDelta eliminates the need for a default learning rate by using a moving window
of gradient updates. It adapts learning rates based on recent gradient magnitudes to ensure consistent
updates even with sparse gradients.
Pros:
• Eliminates the need to set a default learning rate.
• Addresses the diminishing learning rate issue.
• Does not require manual tuning of the learning rate.
• Handles gradient sparsity well.
Cons:
• More complex than RMSprop and AdaGrad.
• Can have slower convergence initially.
• Can require more iterations to converge.
• Implementation can be more complex.
When to Use: AdaDelta is suitable for scenarios similar to RMSprop but is preferred when avoiding
manual learning rate setting.
30
5.4.7
Adam
Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam) combines the advantages of AdaGrad and RMSprop, making it
suitable for problems with large datasets and high-dimensional spaces.
How it Works: Adam uses running averages of both gradients and their squared values to com-
pute adaptive learning rates for each parameter. It includes bias correction and often achieves faster
convergence than other methods.
Pros:
• Combines advantages of AdaGrad and RMSprop.
• Adaptive learning rates.
• Includes bias correction.
• Fast convergence.
• Works well with large datasets and high-dimensional spaces.
Cons:
• Requires tuning of hyperparameters (though it often works well with defaults).
• Computationally intensive.
• Can lead to overfitting if not regularised properly.
• Requires more memory.
When to Use: Adam is widely used in most deep learning applications due to its efficiency and
effectiveness, particularly in complex neural network architectures.
5.4.8
AdamW
AdamW is an extension of Adam that includes weight decay regularisation to address overfitting issues
present in Adam.
How it Works: AdamW integrates L2 regularisation directly into the parameter updates, decoupling
weight decay from the learning rate. This improves generalisation and is suitable for fine-tuning large
models.
Pros:
• Includes weight decay for better regularisation.
• Combines Adam’s adaptive learning rate with L2 regularisation.
• Improves generalisation.
• Reduces overfitting compared to Adam.
Cons:
• Slightly more complex than Adam.
• Requires careful tuning of the weight decay parameter.
• Slightly slower than Adam due to additional computations.
• Requires more memory.
When to Use: AdamW is ideal for scenarios where regularisation is needed, such as preventing
overfitting in large models and fine-tuning pre-trained models.
A comprehensive collection of optimisation algorithms implemented within the PyTorch library can be
found in here. The Hugging Face Transformers package also offers a variety of optimisers for initialising
and fine-tuning language models, available here.

5.5
Challenges in Training Setup
1. Ensuring compatibility and proper configuration of high-performance hardware like GPUs or TPUs
can be complex and time-consuming.
2. Managing dependencies and versions of deep learning frameworks and libraries to avoid conflicts
and leverage the latest features.
3. Selecting an appropriate learning rate is critical, as too high a rate can cause suboptimal conver-
gence, while too low a rate can make the training process excessively slow.
4. Determining the optimal batch size that balances memory constraints and training efficiency, es-
pecially given the large memory requirements of LLMs.
5. Choosing the right number of epochs to avoid underfitting or overfitting the model, requiring careful
monitoring and validation.
6. Selecting the most suitable optimiser for the specific training task to efficiently update the model’s
weights.
7. Choosing the correct loss function to accurately measure model performance and guide the opti-
misation process.
5.6
Best Practices
• Optimal Learning Rate: Use a lower learning rate, typically between 1e-4 to 2e-4, to ensure
stable convergence. A learning rate schedule, such as learning rate warm-up followed by a linear
decay, can also be beneficial. This helps in initially stabilising the training and then allowing the
model to converge more accurately.
• Batch Size Considerations: Opt for a batch size that balances memory constraints and training
efficiency.
Smaller batch sizes can help in achieving faster convergence but may require more
frequent updates. Conversely, larger batch sizes can be more memory-intensive but may lead to
more stable updates. Experiment with different batch sizes to find the optimal balance for your
specific use case.
• Save Checkpoints Regularly: Regularly save model weights at various intervals across 5-8
epochs to capture optimal performance without overfitting. Implement early stopping mechanisms
to halt training once the model performance starts to degrade on the validation set, thereby pre-
venting overfitting [51].
• Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilise hyperparameter tuning methods like grid search, random
search, and Bayesian optimisation to find the optimal set of hyperparameters.
Tools such as
Optuna, Hyperopt, and Ray Tune can automate this process and help in efficiently exploring the
hyperparameter space [49].
• Data Parallelism and Model Parallelism: For large-scale training, consider using data paral-
lelism or model parallelism techniques to distribute the training workload across multiple GPUs or
TPUs. Libraries like Horovod and DeepSpeed can facilitate efficient distributed training, helping
to reduce training time and manage memory usage effectively [52, 53].
• Regular Monitoring and Logging: Implement robust monitoring and logging to track training
metrics, resource usage, and potential bottlenecks. Tools like TensorBoard, Weights & Biases, and
MLflow can provide real-time insights into the training process, allowing for timely interventions
and adjustments.
• Handling Overfitting and Underfitting: Ensure that your model generalises well by imple-
menting techniques to handle overfitting and underfitting. regularisation techniques such as L2
regularisation, dropout, and data augmentation can help prevent overfitting. Conversely, if your
model is underfitting, consider increasing the model complexity or training for more epochs.
32
• Use Mixed Precision Training: Mixed precision training involves using both 16-bit and 32-bit
floating-point types to reduce memory usage and increase computational efficiency. This technique
can significantly speed up training and reduce the required memory footprint, especially when
using large models. NVIDIA’s Apex and TensorFlow’s mixed precision API provide support for
implementing mixed precision training [54].
• Evaluate and Iterate: Continuously evaluate the model performance using a separate validation
set and iterate on the training process based on the results. Regularly update your training data
and retrain the model to keep it current with new data trends and patterns.
• Documentation and Reproducibility: Maintain thorough documentation of your training
setup, including the hardware configuration, software environment, and hyperparameters used.
Ensure reproducibility by setting random seeds and providing detailed records of the training
process. This practice not only aids in debugging and further development but also facilitates
collaboration and sharing of results with the broader research community.

Chapter 6
Stage 4: Selection of Fine-Tuning
Techniques and Appropriate Model
Configurations
This chapter focuses on selecting appropriate fine-tuning techniques and model configurations that suit
the specific requirements of various tasks. Fine-tuning is a crucial stage where pre-trained models are
adapted to specific tasks or domains.
6.1
Steps Involved in Fine-Tuning
The following steps outline the fine-tuning process, integrating advanced techniques and best practices.
1. Initialise the Pre-Trained Tokenizer and Model: Begin by loading the pre-trained tokenizer
and model. The tokenizer ensures that the input text is converted into a format the model can
process, while the pre-trained model serves as the foundation for further adaptation. Depending
on the task, select a model that has been pre-trained on relevant data to provide a strong starting
point.
2. Modify the Model’s Output Layer: Adjust the model’s output layer to align with the specific
requirements of the target task. This may involve modifying existing layers or adding new layers.
For instance, tasks like classification may require a softmax layer with the appropriate number of
classes, while text generation tasks might involve changes in the decoding mechanism.
3. Choose an Appropriate Fine-Tuning Strategy: Select the fine-tuning strategy that best fits
the task and the model architecture. Some Options include:
• Task-Specific Fine-Tuning: For tasks such as text summarisation, code generation, classi-
fication, and question answering, adapt the model using relevant datasets.
• Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning: Tailor the model to comprehend and generate text relevant
to specific domains, such as medical, financial, or legal fields.
• Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT): Techniques like LoRA, QLoRA, and adapters
allow for fine-tuning with reduced computational costs by updating a small subset of model
parameters.
• Half Fine-Tuning (HFT): Balance between retaining pre-trained knowledge and learning
new tasks by updating only half of the model’s parameters during each fine-tuning round.
4. Set Up the Training Loop: Establish the training loop, incorporating the selected fine-tuning
strategy. The loop should include data loading, loss computation, backpropagation, and parameter
updates.
When using PEFT methods, ensure that only the relevant parameters are updated
to maximise efficiency. Implement techniques like dynamic learning rates and early stopping to
enhance the training process.
34
5. Incorporate Techniques for Handling Multiple Tasks: If fine-tuning for multiple tasks,
consider strategies like fine-tuning with multiple adapters or leveraging Mixture of Experts (MoE)
architectures. These methods allow a single model to handle various tasks by utilising specialised
sub-networks or adapters for each task.
6. Monitor Performance on a Validation Set: Regularly evaluate the model’s performance on
a validation set to ensure it generalises well to unseen data.
Adjust hyperparameters such as
learning rate, batch size, and dropout rates based on the validation performance. Utilise advanced
monitoring tools to track metrics like accuracy, loss, and overfitting.
7. Optimise Model Using Advanced Techniques: Employ techniques such as Proximal Policy
Optimisation (PPO) for reinforcement learning scenarios, or Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO)
for aligning model outputs with human preferences. These techniques are particularly useful in
fine-tuning models for tasks requiring nuanced decision-making or human-like responses.
8. Prune and optimise the Model (if necessary): To deploy the model in resource-constrained
environments, consider pruning techniques to reduce its size and complexity. This involves removing
unnecessary parameters or components without significantly affecting performance. Utilise dynamic
pruning methods during inference to optimise the model on-the-fly for different scenarios.
9. Continuous Evaluation and Iteration: Continuously evaluate the model’s performance across
various tasks using appropriate benchmarks. Iterate on the fine-tuning process, making adjustments
based on performance metrics and real-world testing. This iterative approach helps in refining the
model to meet specific performance criteria.

Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) Techniques
Parameter Efficient Fine Tuning (PEFT) is an impactful NLP technique that adeptly adapts pre-trained
language models to various applications with remarkable efficiency. PEFT methods fine-tune only a
small subset of (additional) model parameters while keeping most of the pre-trained LLM parameters
frozen, thereby significantly reducing computational and storage costs. This approach mitigates the issue
of catastrophic forgetting, a phenomenon where neural networks lose previously acquired knowledge and
experience a significant performance decline on previously learned tasks when trained on new datasets.
PEFT methods have demonstrated superior performance compared to full fine-tuning, particularly in
low-data scenarios, and exhibit better generalisation to out-of-domain contexts. This technique is appli-
cable to various modalities, such as financial sentiment classification and machine translation of medical
terminologies. A taxonomy of PEFT-based fine-tuning approaches is provided in Figure6.1. We will
further discuss a few key PEFT-based approaches in the following sections.
6.3.1
Adapters
Adapter-based methods introduce additional trainable parameters after the attention and fully connected
layers of a frozen pre-trained model, aiming to reduce memory usage and accelerate training. The specific
approach varies depending on the adapter; it might involve adding an extra layer or representing the
weight updates delta (W) as a low-rank decomposition of the weight matrix. Regardless of the method,
adapters are generally small yet achieve performance comparable to fully fine-tuned models, allowing for
the training of larger models with fewer resources.
HuggingFace supports adapter configurations through the PEFT library. During fine-tuning, new adapters
are integrated into the model using LoraConfig 1. HuggingFace uses PeftConfig to load existing pre-
trained models and apply PEFT techniques. Additionally, HuggingFace provides built-in support to

Tuning, and their respective sub-techniques like LoRA and its derivatives, showcasing the diverse and
evolving landscape of LLM fine-tuning. (adapted from [60])
run the fine-tuning process across any distributed configuration using Accelerate2, making large-scale
training and inference simple, efficient, and adaptable.
6.3.2
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)[62] is a technique designed for fine-tuning large language models, which
modifies the fine-tuning process by freezing the original model weights and applying changes to a separate
set of weights, added to the original parameters. LoRA transforms the model parameters into a lower-
rank dimension, reducing the number of trainable parameters, speeding up the process, and lowering
costs. This method is particularly useful in scenarios where multiple clients require fine-tuned models
for different applications, allowing for the creation of specific weights for each use case without the
need for separate models. By employing low-rank approximation methods, LoRA effectively reduces
computational and resource requirements while preserving the pre-trained model’s adaptability to specific
tasks or domains.
Benefits of Using LoRA
1. Parameter Efficiency: LoRA significantly reduces the number of parameters that need to be
trained by focusing only on the low-rank matrices, resulting in lower memory and storage require-
ments compared to full fine-tuning.
2. Efficient Storage: The storage of the trained model is more efficient as it only requires storing
the low-rank matrices instead of the full model weights.

the integration of adapters within the Transformer architecture, including the feed-forward up and down
layers and their role in enabling efficient model adaptation by inserting additional parameters while
maintaining the model’s core structure (adapted from [61])
3. Reduced Computational Load: Training with low-rank matrices requires fewer computational
resources, making it faster and more scalable.
4. Lower Memory Footprint: Since fewer parameters are being updated, the memory footprint
during training is reduced, enabling the use of larger batch sizes or more complex models within
the same hardware constraints.
5. Flexibility: LoRA can be easily integrated with existing pre-trained models without extensive
modifications to the model architecture.
6. Compatibility: It can be used alongside other fine-tuning techniques, such as adapter layers or
prompt-tuning, to further enhance performance.
7. Comparable Results: Despite the reduction in the number of trainable parameters, LoRA has
been shown to achieve performance comparable to full fine-tuning in many tasks.
8. Task-Specific Adaptation: It effectively adapts the pre-trained model to specific tasks, leverag-
ing the knowledge already embedded in the original model.
9. Avoiding Overfitting: By focusing on low-rank updates, LoRA can help in mitigating overfitting,
especially when dealing with smaller task-specific datasets.
Limitations
While LoRA demonstrates considerable power, it also presents challenges:
• Fine-tuning Scope: LoRA may face difficulties when applied to tasks demanding substantial
alterations to the pre-trained model’s internal representations.
• Hyperparameter Optimisation: Tuning the rank parameter ‘r’ requires meticulous adjustment
for optimal performance.
• Ongoing Research: Despite its promise, LoRA is still in active research stages, and its long-term
implications remain to be fully explored.
39
Figure 6.3: A comparison between weight updates in regular fine-tuning and LoRA fine-tuning.
In
regular fine-tuning, the entire weight update matrix (∆W) is applied to the pre-trained weights. In
contrast, LoRA fine-tuning introduces two low-rank matrices (A and B) that approximate the weight
update matrix (∆W), significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters by leveraging the inner
dimension (r), which is a hyperparameter.
This method is more efficient in terms of memory and
computation, making it ideal for fine-tuning large models. (adapted from [63])
Despite these challenges, LoRA stands as a pioneering technique with vast potential to democratise access
to the capabilities of LLMs. Continued research and development offer the prospect of overcoming current
limitations and unlocking even greater efficiency and adaptability.

An open-source template for fine-tuning LLMs using the LoRA method with the Hugging Face library
can be found here. This template is designed specifically for adapting LLMs for instruction fine-tuning
processes.
6.3.3
QLoRA
QLoRA[64] is an extended version of LoRA designed for greater memory efficiency in large language mod-
els (LLMs) by quantising weight parameters to 4-bit precision. Typically, LLM parameters are stored
in a 32-bit format, but QLoRA compresses them to 4-bit, significantly reducing the memory footprint.
This allows fine-tuning on less powerful hardware, including consumer GPUs. QLoRA also quantises the
weights of the LoRA adapters from 8-bit to 4-bit, further decreasing memory and storage requirements
(see Figure 6.4). Despite the reduction in bit precision, QLoRA maintains performance levels comparable
to traditional 16-bit fine-tuning.
It achieves this by backpropagating gradients through a frozen, 4-bit quantised pre-trained language
model into Low-Rank Adapters, making the fine-tuning process efficient while preserving model effective-
ness. The QLoRA configuration is supported by HuggingFace via the PEFT library, utilising LoraConfig
and BitsAndBytesConfig for quantisation. Innovations such as an optimal 4-bit data type, double quan-
tisation of constants, and memory spike management enable QLoRA to reduce memory usage from 96
bits per parameter in traditional fine-tuning to 5.2 bits per parameter, an 18-fold reduction.
Performance-wise, QLoRA outperforms naive 4-bit quantisation and matches 16-bit quantised models
on benchmarks. Additionally, QLoRA enabled the fine-tuning of a high-quality 4-bit chatbot using a
single GPU in 24 hours, achieving quality comparable to ChatGPT.
This tutorial explains the end-to-end steps of fine-tuning QLoRA on a custom dataset for the Phi-2
model.

the QLoRA optimisation process, showing how the optimisation states, adapters, and the model interact
during fine-tuning. It demonstrates the use of different bit-widths (32-bit, 16-bit, and 4-bit) to optimise
the memory and computational efficiency during the fine-tuning of large language models (adapted from
[65]).
6.3.4
Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA)
In the context of optimising model fine-tuning, the pattern analysis of LoRA and Full Fine-Tuning
(FT) reveals significant differences in learning behaviours and updates. LoRA, employing a strategy of
incrementally updating pre-trained weights using the product of two low-rank matrices, maintains the
original weights largely static during the fine-tuning process, which allows for efficient inference. Despite
its computational efficiency, previous studies have suggested that LoRA’s limited number of trainable
parameters might contribute to its performance discrepancies when compared to FT.
Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) [66] is a novel fine-tuning methodology designed to
optimise pre-trained models by decomposing their weights into magnitude and directional components.
This approach leverages the efficiency of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for directional updates, facili-
tating substantial parameter updates without altering the entire model architecture. DoRA addresses
the computational challenges associated with traditional full fine-tuning (FT) by maintaining model
simplicity and inference efficiency, while simultaneously bridging the performance gap typically observed
between LoRA and FT. Empirical and theoretical evaluations demonstrate that DoRA not only achieves
learning outcomes comparable to FT across diverse tasks—including natural language processing and
vision-language applications—but also consistently surpasses LoRA in performance, providing a robust
solution for enhancing the adaptability and efficiency of large-scale models.
Python Library - DoRA is facilitated via the HuggingFace LoraConfig package. To incorporate DoRA
into the fine-tuning process, it is essential to specify the ’use dora = True’ parameter during the Lora
configuration. Further information on initialisation can be found here.
Benefits of DoRA
1. Enhanced Learning Capacity: DoRA achieves a learning capacity closely resembling full fine-
tuning (FT) by decomposing pre-trained weights into magnitude and directional components, al-
lowing for more nuanced updates.
2. Efficient Fine-Tuning: By utilising the structural advantages of Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
for directional updates, DoRA enables efficient fine-tuning without altering the entire model archi-
tecture.
3. No Additional Inference Latency: Despite its improved learning capabilities, DoRA does not
introduce any additional inference latency over LoRA, maintaining model simplicity and efficiency.
4. Superior Performance: Experimental results demonstrate that DoRA consistently outperforms
LoRA across a wide range of tasks, including natural language processing (NLP), visual instruction
tuning, and image/video-text understanding. For example, it shows significant improvements in
commonsense reasoning and visual instruction tuning benchmarks.
5. Versatility Across Backbones: DoRA has been validated across various model backbones,
including large language models (LLM) and vision-language models (LVLM), indicating its broad

direction. The right section shows how these decomposed weights are merged with trainable parameters
during fine-tuning, resulting in updated weights that combine both frozen (blue) and trainable (green)
components. The process emphasises efficient adaptation by focusing on the most significant directions
in the parameter space, facilitating effective fine-tuning while maintaining the integrity of the original

applicability and robustness in different domains.
6. Innovative Analysis: The introduction of a novel weight decomposition analysis helps uncover
fundamental differences in the learning patterns of FT and various parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) methods, contributing to a deeper understanding of model fine-tuning dynamics.
Comparison between LoRA and DoRA
Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) and Weight-Decomposed Low-Rank Adaptation (DoRA) are both ad-
vanced techniques designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of fine-tuning large pre-trained
models. While they share the common goal of reducing computational overhead, they employ different
strategies to achieve this (see Table6.2).

6.3.5
Fine-Tuning with Multiple Adapters
During fine-tuning, we have explored the method of freezing the parameters of the LLM and focusing
solely on fine-tuning a few million trainable parameters using LoRA. For example, fine-tuning an LLM
for translation involves training a translation adapter with relevant data. This approach allows us to
fine-tune separate adapters for each specific task we want the LLM to perform. However, a key question
arises: can we consolidate multiple adapters into a unified multi-task adapter? For instance, if we have
separate adapters for translation and summarisation tasks, can we merge them so that the LLM can
proficiently handle both tasks? (Illustrated via Figure6.6).
The PEFT library simplifies the process of merging adapters with its add weighted adapter function 3,
which offers three distinct methods:
1. Concatenation: This straightforward method concatenates the parameters of the adapters. For
instance, if two adapters each have a rank of 16, the resulting adapter will have a rank of 32. This
method is highly efficient.
2. Linear Combination: Although less documented, this method appears to perform a weighted
sum of the adapters’ parameters.
3. SVD: The default method employs singular value decomposition through torch.linalg.svd. While
versatile, it is notably slower than the other methods, particularly for adapters with high ranks
(greater than 100), which can take several hours.
Each method allows for customising the combination by adjusting weights. For instance, when merging
two adapters, X and Y, assigning more weight to X ensures that the resulting adapter prioritises behaviour
similar to X over Y.
This approach is particularly suited for consolidating a single LLM to handle multiple tasks rather than
creating separate models for each task domain. By adopting this method, there is no longer a need to
3https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/main/en/package_reference/lora#peft.LoraModel.add_weighted_adapter
43
individually fine-tune a model for each task. Instead, a single adapter layer can be fine-tuned for each
task, allowing queries to yield the desired responses efficiently.
Figure 6.6: Overview of how multiple adapters can be used with a pre-trained LLM to fine-tune it for
various specific tasks, such as summarisation, proofreading, sentiment analysis, and more. (adapted from
[67])
Steps for Fine-Tuning LLM with LoRA for Multiple Tasks and Adapters
1. Adapter Creation: Create multiple adapters, each fine-tuned for specific tasks using different
prompt formats or task-identifying tags (e.g., [translate fren], [chat]).
2. LoRA Integration: Implement LoRA to efficiently integrate these adapters into the pre-trained
LLM. Utilise LoRA’s methods such as concatenation, linear combination, or singular value decom-
position (SVD) to combine adapters while minimising computational overhead and maintaining
performance.
3. Task-Specific Adaptation: Fine-tune each adapter with task-specific data to enhance perfor-
mance for individual tasks. Ensure adapters are trained with data relevant to their respective
tasks, optimising their ability to generate accurate responses.
4. Behaviour Adjustment: Monitor the behaviour of combined adapters to identify any undesired
inherited behaviours from individual adapters (e.g., short response generation from a translation
44
adapter). Adjust the combination weights or types to modify adapter behaviour as needed, ensuring
each adapter performs optimally for its intended task.
5. Evaluation and Iteration: Evaluate the performance of the combined model across multiple
tasks using validation datasets. Iterate on the fine-tuning process, making adjustments to adapter
combinations and training parameters based on performance metrics and user feedback.
Therefore, for optimal performance, it is advisable to combine adapters that have been fine-tuned with
distinctly varied prompt formats. However, even when using adapters with different prompt formats, the
resulting adapter may not exhibit desired behaviour. For example, a newly combined adapter designed for
chatting may only generate short responses, inheriting this tendency from an adapter that was originally
trained to halt after producing a single sentence. To adjust the behaviour of the combined adapter,
one can prioritise the influence of a specific adapter during the combination process and/or modify the
method of combination used.
An illustrative tutorial demonstrating the fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) using multiple
adapter layers for various tasks can be found here.
6.4
Half Fine Tuning
Half Fine-Tuning (HFT)[68] is a technique designed to balance the retention of foundational knowledge
with the acquisition of new skills in large language models (LLMs). HFT involves freezing half of the
model’s parameters during each fine-tuning round while updating the other half, allowing the model to
retain pre-trained knowledge and enhance new task performance without altering the model architecture.
Each repetitive transformer layer is divided into three blocks: self-attention, feed-forward, and layernorm,
with half of the parameters in each block updated and the other half frozen, varying with each round.
This strategic parameter update helps maintain knowledge parity across training rounds and enhances
scalability in successive training sessions.
Research on models like LLAMA 2-7B demonstrated that HFT could significantly restore forgotten basic
knowledge while preserving high general ability performance. This method’s robustness and efficiency
make it applicable to various fine-tuning scenarios, including supervised fine-tuning, direct preference
optimisation, and continual learning. Additionally, HFT’s ability to maintain the model architecture
simplifies its implementation and ensures compatibility with existing systems, further promoting its
practical adoption.
6.4.1
Benefits of using Half Fine tuning
1. Recovery of Pre-Trained Knowledge: By rolling back half of the fine-tuned parameters to their
pre-trained state, HFT effectively recovers a portion of the original knowledge, thereby mitigating
catastrophic forgetting of previously acquired capabilities.
2. Enhanced Performance: Research experiments shows that HFT maintains or even surpasses
the performance of full fine-tuning (FFT) on downstream tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in
balancing knowledge retention with task-specific learning.
3. Robustness: The method is robust to different selection strategies and the number of parameters
chosen for updating, ensuring consistent performance across various configurations.
4. Simplicity and Scalability: HFT does not alter the model architecture, which simplifies im-
plementation and allows for scalable applications, particularly beneficial in successive fine-tuning
scenarios.
5. Versatility: The technique has proven effective across diverse fine-tuning scenarios, including
supervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimisation, and continual learning.

6.5
Lamini Memory Tuning
Lamini [69] was introduced as a specialised approach to fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs),
targeting the reduction of hallucinations. This development was motivated by the need to enhance the
reliability and precision of LLMs in domains requiring accurate information retrieval. Traditional training
methods typically consist of running stochastic gradient descent on vast datasets, which, despite fitting
the training data well, often produce models that fail to generalise effectively and are prone to such errors.
Foundation models often follow a training regimen similar to the Chinchilla recipe, which prescribes
training for a single epoch on a massive corpus, such as training Llama 2 7B on about one trillion
tokens. This approach results in substantial loss and is geared more towards enhancing generalisation
and creativity where a degree of randomness in token selection is permissible. However, it falls short for
tasks demanding high factual precision. In contrast, Lamini Memory Tuning delves deeper by analysing
the loss of individual facts, significantly improving the accuracy of factual recall.
By augmenting a
model with additional parameters specifically for memory (e.g., an 8B parameter model with an extra 2B
parameters for weights), Lamini enables the model to memorise and accurately recall a significant number
of facts, closely aligning performance with LLM scaling laws without compromising on generalisation.
6.5.1
Lamini-1 - A model architecture based on Lamini
Departing from traditional transformer-based designs, the Lamini-1 model architecture (Figure 6.8) em-
ploys a massive mixture of memory experts (MoME). This system features a pre-trained transformer
backbone augmented by adapters that are dynamically selected from an index using cross-attention
mechanisms. These adapters function similarly to experts in MoE architectures, and the network is
trained end-to-end while freezing the backbone. This setup allows for specific facts to be stored exactly
in the selected experts.
Figure 6.8: Diagram of the Lamini-1 Model Architecture, featuring a Massive Array of Memory Experts
(MoME). This architecture integrates a pre-trained transformer backbone with dynamically selected
adapters via cross-attention mechanisms. Each adapter, functioning as a memory expert, is capable of
storing specific factual data. (adopted from [69])
At inference time, only the relevant experts are retrieved from the index, enabling the LLM to store a
large number of facts while maintaining low inference latency. Specialised GPU kernels written in Triton
are used to accelerate the lookup of experts, optimising the system for quick access to stored knowledge.
Systems Optimisations for Banishing Hallucinations
The MoME architecture is designed to minimise the computational demand required to memorise facts.
During training, a subset of experts, such as 32 out of a million, is selected for each fact. The weights of
the backbone network and the cross attention used to select the expert are frozen, and gradient descent
steps are taken until the loss is sufficiently reduced to memorise the fact. This approach prevents the
same expert from being selected multiple times for different facts by first training the cross attention
47
selection mechanism during a generalisation training phase, then freezing its weights.
This method ensures that computation scales with the number of training examples, not the total
number of parameters, thereby significantly reducing the computation required for memory tuning.
This optimised approach allows Lamini-1 to achieve near-zero loss in memory tuning on real and random
answers efficiently, demonstrating its efficacy in eliminating hallucinations while improving factual recall.
6.6
Mixture of Experts
A mixture of experts (MoE) is an architectural design for neural networks that divides the computation
of a layer or operation (e.g., linear layers, MLPs, or attention projection) into several specialised subnet-
works, referred to as ”experts”. Each expert independently carries out its computation, and the results
are aggregated to produce the final output of the MoE layer. MoE architectures can be categorised as
either dense, where every expert is engaged for each input, or sparse, where only a subset of experts is
utilised for each input.
6.6.1
Mixtral 8x7B Architecture and Performance
Mixtral [70] 8x7B employs a Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) architecture (Figure 6.9), mirroring the
structure of Mistral 7B but incorporating eight feedforward blocks (experts) in each layer. For every
token at each layer, a router network selects two experts to process the current state and combine their
outputs. Although each token interacts with only two experts at a time, the selected experts can vary at
each timestep. Consequently, each token has access to 47 billion parameters but utilises only 13 billion
active parameters during inference. Mixtral 8x7B not only matches but often surpasses Llama 2 70B
and GPT-3.5 across all evaluated benchmarks. Its performance is notably superior to Llama 2 70B in
mathematics, code generation, and multilingual tasks.
Figure 6.9: Diagram of the Mixtral 8x7B Mixture of Experts (MoE) model architecture. The model is
composed of a router network that dynamically selects the most relevant experts from a pool of eight
transformer-based experts, each with 7 billion parameters. The experts are organised into transformer
blocks, where the router directs data to the appropriate expert based on the input, optimising com-
putational efficiency and model performance. This architecture allows for scalability and specialised
processing within large language models. (adapted from [71])

6.7
Mixture of Agents
Despite the numerous LLMs and their notable accomplishments, they continue to encounter fundamental
limitations regarding model size and training data. Scaling these models further is prohibitively expen-
sive, often necessitating extensive retraining on multiple trillion tokens. Simultaneously, different LLMs
exhibit distinct strengths and specialise in various aspects of tasks. A recent study has investigated
leveraging the collective expertise of multiple LLMs to develop a more capable and robust model, a
method known as Mixture of Agents (MoA) [72].
MoA functions using a layered architecture, where each layer comprises multiple LLM agents (Figure
6.10). This structure reveals a phenomenon known as the “collaborativeness of LLMs.” The innova-
tive MoA framework utilises the combined capabilities of several LLMs to enhance both reasoning and
language generation proficiency. Research indicates that LLMs naturally collaborate, demonstrating im-
proved response quality when incorporating outputs from other models, even if those outputs are not
ideal.
Figure 6.10: Illustration for Mixture of Agents (MoA) LLM configuration. The model consists of multiple
layers, each incorporating several agents that process the input independently before concatenating their
outputs to form an intermediate result. The process continues across layers, refining the output at each
stage to generate the final output based on the given prompt (adapted from [72]).
6.7.1
Methodology
To enhance collaboration among multiple LLMs, it is essential to understand their individual strengths
and classify them accordingly. The classification includes:
1. Proposers: These models excel at generating valuable reference responses for other models. While
they may not perform exceptionally on their own, they provide useful context and varied perspec-
tives that improve the final output when utilised by an aggregator.
49
2. Aggregators: These models are adept at merging responses from various models into a single
high-quality result. An effective aggregator should maintain or even enhance the quality of the
final response, regardless of the quality of the individual inputs.
The careful selection of LLMs for each MoA layer is crucial Performance metrics, such as average win
rates in a given layer, help assess the suitability of models for subsequent layers, ensuring the production
of higher-quality outputs. Diversity in model outputs is vital, as varied responses from different models
contribute significantly more than homogeneous outputs from a single model. In MoA, given an input
prompt, the output of the ith MoA layer yi is calculated as follows:
yi =
n
M
j=1
[Ai,j(xi)] + x1, xi+1 = yi
(6.1)
6.7.2
Analogy with MoE
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) is a well-established machine learning technique where multiple expert net-
works, each with specialised skills, collaborate to address complex problems. This approach has demon-
strated significant success across various applications and serves as the inspiration for the Mixture-of-
Agents (MoA) method. In a typical MoE design, a stack of layers, known as MoE layers, consists of
multiple expert networks, a gating network, and residual connections to improve gradient flow. The
output for layer yi is calculated as follows:
yi =
n
X
j=1
Gi,j(xi)Ei,j(xi) + xi
(6.2)
The MoA framework advances the MoE concept by operating at the model level through prompt-based
interactions rather than altering internal activations or weights. Instead of relying on specialised sub-
networks within a single model, MoA utilises multiple full-fledged LLMs across different layers. In this
approach, the gating and expert networks’ functions are integrated within an LLM, leveraging its ability
to interpret prompts and generate coherent outputs without additional coordination mechanisms.
6.7.3
What makes MoA works well?
1. MoA’s Superior Performance: MoA significantly outperforms LLM-based rankers, which select
one answer from the proposals rather than generating new responses. This suggests that MoA’s
approach of aggregating all generated responses provides more effective results than simply choosing
from pre-existing options.
2. Effective Incorporation of Proposals: The aggregator in MoA demonstrates a tendency to
integrate the best proposed answers. This is supported by positive correlations between aggregator
responses and various similarity metrics, such as BLEU scores, which measure n-gram overlaps. The
use of alternative similarity measures also shows a consistent positive correlation with preference
scores, indicating that the aggregator effectively utilises the proposed responses.
3. Influence of Model Diversity and Proposer Count: Increasing the number of proposers
improves output quality, highlighting the benefits of additional auxiliary information. Additionally,
using a diverse set of LLMs as proposers consistently yields better results compared to using a single
LLM. This suggests that both the number and diversity of LLM agents in each MoA layer contribute
to enhanced performance, with potential for further improvement through scaling.
4. Model Specialisation: Analysis of model roles within the MoA ecosystem reveals that GPT-4o,
Qwen, and LLaMA-3 are effective in both assisting and aggregating tasks. In contrast, WizardLM
excels as a proposer but struggles with aggregating responses from other models.
6.8
Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO)
PPO [73] is a widely recognised reinforcement learning algorithm used for training agents to perform tasks
in diverse environments. This algorithm leverages policy gradient methods, where policies—represented
50
by neural networks—determine the actions taken by the agent based on the current state. PPO ef-
fectively handles the dynamic nature of training data generated through continuous agent-environment
interactions, a feature that differentiates it from static datasets used in supervised learning.
The innovation of PPO lies in its ”surrogate” objective function, optimised via stochastic gradient ascent.
This approach allows for multiple updates from the same batch of data, enhancing both training efficiency
and stability over traditional policy gradient methods. Developed by OpenAI, PPO was designed to
balance ease of implementation with the robust performance characteristics of more complex algorithms
like Trust Region Policy Optimisation (TRPO), but without the associated computational complexity.
PPO operates by maximising expected cumulative rewards through iterative policy adjustments that
increase the likelihood of actions leading to higher rewards. A key feature of PPO is its use of a clipping
mechanism in the objective function, which limits the extent of policy updates, thus preventing drastic
changes and maintaining stability during training.
Figure 6.11: Schematic of Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) applied in the context of Reinforcement
Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) for fine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM). The process
involves using a prompt dataset to train the LLM. The PPO algorithm adjusts the LLM’s policy based
on rewards provided by the reward model, which is fine-tuned through human feedback. (adapted from
[73])
Python Library - HuggingFace Transformer Reinforcement Learning (TRL4) package supports the
PPO Trainer5 for training language models from the preference data.
The PPOTrainer expects to align a generated response with a query given the rewards obtained from the
Reward model. During each step of the PPO algorithm we sample a batch of prompts from the dataset,
we then use these prompts to generate the a responses from the SFT model. Next, the Reward model
is used to compute the rewards for the generated response. Finally, these rewards are used to optimise
the SFT model using the PPO algorithm. Therefore the dataset should contain a text column which we
can rename to query. Each of the other data-points required to optimise the SFT model are obtained
during the training loop.
6.8.1
Benefits of PPO
1. Stability: Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) is designed to ensure stable and reliable policy
updates. The clipped surrogate objective function is central to this stability, as it limits policy
updates to prevent large, potentially destabilising changes. This results in smoother and more
consistent learning.
2. Ease of Implementation: Compared to advanced algorithms TRPO, PPO is relatively straight-
forward to implement. It avoids the need for second-order optimisation techniques, making it more
4https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/en/index
5https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/main/en/ppo_trainer
51
accessible to less experienced practitioners.
3. Sample Efficiency: PPO achieves data efficiency through its use of the clipped surrogate objec-
tive. This mechanism regulates policy updates, ensuring stability while effectively reusing training
data.
Consequently, PPO tends to be more sample-efficient than other reinforcement learning
algorithms, performing well with fewer samples, which is advantageous in scenarios where data
collection is costly or time-consuming.
6.8.2
Limitations of PPO
1. Complexity and Computational Cost: Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) involves intricate
policy and value networks, necessitating substantial computational resources for training. This
complexity often results in extended training durations and increased operational expenses.
2. Hyperparameter Sensitivity: PPO’s performance is highly dependent on several hyperparame-
ters, such as the clipping range, learning rate, and discount factor. Achieving optimal performance
requires meticulous tuning of these parameters. Incorrect settings can lead to suboptimal policy
outcomes or instability during the learning process.
3. Stability and Convergence Issues: Although PPO is designed to enhance stability compared
to earlier methods, it can still encounter convergence issues, particularly in highly dynamic or
complex environments. Maintaining stable policy updates remains a significant challenge.
4. Reward Signal Dependence: PPO’s effectiveness is heavily reliant on a well-defined reward
signal to guide the learning process. In scenarios where designing an appropriate reward function
is challenging or impractical, PPO may struggle to attain the desired results.

technique can be found here.
6.9
Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO)
Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) [74] offers a streamlined approach to aligning language models
(LMs) with human preferences, bypassing the complexity of reinforcement learning from human feedback
(RLHF). Large-scale unsupervised LMs typically lack precise behavioural control, necessitating meth-
ods like RLHF that fine-tune models using human feedback. However, RLHF is intricate, involving the
creation of reward models and the fine-tuning of LMs to maximise estimated rewards, which can be
unstable and computationally demanding. DPO addresses these challenges by directly optimising LMs
with a simple classification objective that aligns responses with human preferences. This approach elim-
inates the need for explicit reward modelling and extensive hyperparameter tuning, enhancing stability
and efficiency. DPO optimises the desired behaviours by increasing the relative likelihood of preferred
responses while incorporating dynamic importance weights to prevent model degeneration. Thus, DPO
simplifies the preference learning pipeline, making it an effective method for training LMs to adhere to
human preferences.
Python Library - HuggingFace TRL package supports the DPO Trainer6 for training language models
from the preference data. The DPO training process requires a dataset formatted in a very specific
manner. If you are utilising the default DPODataCollatorWithPadding data collator, your final dataset
object must include three specific entries, which should be labelled as follows:
• Prompt
• Chosen
• Rejected
HuggingFace offers datasets compatible with DPO and can be accessed here.
6https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/main/en/dpo_trainer
52
Figure 6.12: Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO) Process Flow. This figure illustrates the Direct
Preference Optimisation (DPO) technique used in fine-tuning large language models. The process begins
with preference data (Yw > Yl), where Yw represents preferred outputs, and Yl represents less preferred
outputs. Through a maximum likelihood estimation process, this preference data is used to optimise
the model’s parameters, resulting in the final large language model (LLM). The method is designed to
improve the alignment of model outputs with desired user preferences, enhancing the model’s effectiveness
in specific tasks. (adapted from [74])
6.9.1
Benefits of DPO
1. Direct Alignment with Human Preferences: DPO directly optimises models to generate
responses that align with human preferences, thereby producing more favourable outputs.
2. Minimised Dependence on Proxy Objectives: In contrast to methods that rely on next-
word prediction, DPO leverages explicit human preferences, resulting in responses that are more
reflective of human behaviour.
3. Enhanced Performance on Subjective Tasks: For tasks requiring subjective judgement, such
as dialogue generation or creative writing, DPO excels in aligning the model with human prefer-
ences.
6.9.2
Best Practices for DPO
1. High-Quality Preference Data: The performance of the model is heavily influenced by the
quality of preference data. Ensure the dataset includes clear and consistent human preferences.
2. Optimal Beta Value: Experiment with various beta values to manage the influence of the
reference model. Higher beta values prioritise the reference model’s preferences more strongly.
3. Hyperparameter Tuning: optimise hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and LoRA
configuration to determine the best settings for your dataset and task.
4. Evaluation on Target Tasks: Continuously assess the model’s performance on the target task
using appropriate metrics to monitor progress and ensure the achievement of desired results.
5. Ethical Considerations: Pay attention to potential biases in the preference data and take steps
to mitigate them, preventing the model from adopting and amplifying these biases.
6.9.3
Tutorial for training models using DPO technique
The tutorial for DPO training, including the full source code of the training scripts for SFT and DPO,
is available here.
6.9.4
Is DPO Superior to PPO for LLM Alignment?
The recent study on DPO superior to PPO for LLM Alignment[75] investigates the efficacy of reward-
based and reward-free methods within RLHF. Reward-based methods, such as those developed by Ope-
nAI, utilise a reward model constructed from preference data and apply actor-critic algorithms like
Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) to optimise the reward signal. Conversely, reward-free methods,
including Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO), RRHF, and PRO, forego an explicit reward function,
53
with DPO focusing exclusively on policy optimisation through a logarithmic representation of the reward
function.
One of the objectives of this study is to determine whether DPO is genuinely superior to PPO in the
RLHF domain. The study combines theoretical and empirical analyses to uncover the inherent limita-
tions of DPO and identify critical factors that enhance PPO’s practical performance in RLHF.
Theoretical findings suggest that DPO may yield biased solutions by exploiting out-of-distribution re-
sponses. Empirical results indicate that DPO’s performance is notably affected by shifts in the distri-
bution between model outputs and the preference dataset. Furthermore, the study highlights that while
iterative DPO may offer improvements over static data training, it still fails to enhance performance
in challenging tasks such as code generation. Ablation studies on PPO reveal essential components for
optimal performance, including advantage normalisation, large batch sizes, and exponential moving av-
erage updates for the reference model’s parameters. These findings form the basis of practical tuning
guidelines, demonstrating PPO’s robust effectiveness across diverse tasks and its ability to achieve state-
of-the-art results in challenging code competition tasks. Specifically, on the CodeContest dataset, the
PPO model with 34 billion parameters surpasses AlphaCode-41B, showing a significant improvement in
performance metrics.
6.10
Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO)
Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO) is a novel approach designed to align the output of lan-
guage models with desired responses by introducing a penalisation mechanism for undesirable outputs.
Unlike traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT) approaches, which focus solely on maximising the likeli-
hood of correct responses, ORPO adds a specific odds-ratio based loss to penalise unwanted generations.
This technique provides a refined method for improving preference alignment without relying on a ref-
erence model, making it efficient for large-scale implementations.
Given an input sequence x, the log-likelihood of generating an output sequence y of length m is
computed as:
log Pθ(y|x) = 1
m
m
X
i=1
log Pθ(yi|x)
The odds of generating the output sequence y given input x is expressed as:
oddsθ(y|x) =
Pθ(y|x)
1 −Pθ(y|x)
ORPO introduces an odds-ratio that contrasts the likelihood of generating a preferred (chosen) re-
sponse yw with a less preferred (rejected) response yl, defined as:
ORθ(yw, yl|x) = oddsθ(yw|x)
oddsθ(yl|x)
The ORPO loss function incorporates two components:
• Supervised Fine-tuning Loss (SFT):
LSF T = −1
M
M
X
k=1
|V |
X
i=1
yk
i log pk
i
where yk
i is a binary indicator for the i-th token in the vocabulary, and pk
i is its predicted probability.
• Odds-Ratio Loss:
LOR = −log σ

log oddsθ(yw|x)
oddsθ(yl|x)

where σ is the sigmoid function applied to stabilise the log odds ratio.
54
Thus, the total ORPO objective is:
LORP O = LSF T + λLOR
where λ controls the strength of preference alignment.
This loss function effectively guides the
model towards generating the chosen response while discouraging the rejected one, facilitating efficient
alignment without the need for additional reference models [76].
Advantages of ORPO: ORPO’s strength lies in its ability to perform preference alignment in a
monolithic manner, bypassing the need for separate phases of fine-tuning and preference optimisation.
This reduces computational overhead and provides state-of-the-art performance across various models,
including LLaMA and Mistral, when evaluated on benchmark tasks such as AlpacaEval and MT-Bench
[77].
6.11
Pruning LLMs
Pruning LLMs involves eliminating unnecessary or redundant components from a neural network to
reduce its size and complexity, thereby enhancing its efficiency and performance. This process assists AI
developers and engineers in addressing the challenges associated with deploying AI models in resource-
limited environments, such as mobile devices, edge computing, or embedded systems. Pruning AI models
can be achieved through various techniques, each suited to the type and structure of the neural network,
the pruning objective, and the pruning criterion. The following are common approaches:
1. Weight Pruning: Involves removing weights or connections with minimal magnitude or impact on
the output. This method reduces the number of parameters and operations in the model, although
it may not necessarily decrease memory footprint or latency.
2. Unit Pruning: Eliminates entire units or neurons with the lowest activation or contribution to
the output. This technique can reduce the model’s memory footprint and latency but may require
retraining or fine-tuning to maintain performance.
3. Filter Pruning: Involves removing entire filters or channels in convolutional neural networks that
have the least importance or relevance to the output. This strategy also reduces memory footprint
and latency, though it may necessitate retraining or fine-tuning to preserve performance [78].
6.11.1
When to Prune AI Models?
Pruning AI models can be conducted at various stages of the model development and deployment cycle,
contingent on the chosen technique and objective.
1. Pre-Training Pruning: Leverages prior knowledge or heuristics to determine the optimal network
structure before training begins. This approach can save time and resources during training but
may necessitate careful design and experimentation to identify the best configuration.
2. Post-Training Pruning: Involves using metrics or criteria to assess the importance or impact of
each network component after training. This method helps maintain model performance but may
require additional validation and testing to ensure quality and robustness.
3. Dynamic Pruning: Adjusts the network structure during inference or runtime based on feedback
or signals. This approach can optimise the model for different scenarios or tasks but may involve
higher computational overhead and complexity to implement and execute.
6.11.2
Benefits of Pruning
1. Reduced Size and Complexity: Pruning decreases the size and complexity of AI models, making
them easier to store, transmit, and update.
2. Improved Efficiency and Performance: Pruned models are faster, more energy-efficient, and
more reliable.
3. Enhanced generalisation and Accuracy: Pruning can make models more robust, less prone
to overfitting, and more adaptable to new data or tasks.
55
6.11.3
Challenges of Pruning
1. Balance Between Size Reduction and Performance: Achieving the optimal balance between
reducing size and complexity and maintaining performance is challenging; excessive or insufficient
pruning can degrade model quality and functionality.
2. Choosing Appropriate Techniques: Selecting the right pruning technique, criterion, and objec-
tive for the specific neural network type and structure is crucial, as different methods can produce
varying effects and outcomes.
3. Evaluation and Validation: Pruned models need thorough evaluation and validation to ensure
pruning has not introduced errors, biases, or vulnerabilities that could impact performance and
robustness.

Chapter 7
Stage 5: Evaluation and Validation
7.1
Steps Involved in Evaluating and Validating Fine-Tuned
Models
1. Set Up Evaluation Metrics: Choose appropriate evaluation metrics, such as cross-entropy, to
measure the difference between the predicted and actual distributions of the data.
2. Interpret Training Loss Curve: Monitor and analyse the training loss curve to ensure the
model is learning effectively, avoiding patterns of underfitting or overfitting.
3. Run Validation Loops: After each training epoch, evaluate the model on the validation set to
compute relevant performance metrics and track the model’s generalisation ability.
4. Monitor and Interpret Results: Consistently observe the relationship between training and
validation metrics to ensure stable and effective model performance.
5. Hyperparameter Tuning and Adjustments: Adjust key hyperparameters such as learning
rate, batch size, and number of training epochs to optimise model performance and prevent over-
fitting.
7.2
Setting Up Evaluation Metrics
Cross-entropy is a key metric for evaluating LLMs during training or fine-tuning.
Originating from
information theory, it quantifies the difference between two probability distributions.
7.2.1
Importance of Cross-Entropy for LLM Training and Evaluation
Cross-entropy is crucial for training and fine-tuning LLMs. It serves as a loss function, guiding the model
to produce high-quality predictions by minimising discrepancies between the predicted and actual data.
In LLMs, each potential word functions as a separate class, and the model’s task is to predict the next
word given the context. This task is inherently complex, requiring the model to understand syntax,
semantics, and context deeply.
7.2.2
Beyond Cross-Entropy: Advanced LLM Evaluation Metrics
While cross-entropy remains fundamental, evaluating LLMs effectively necessitates additional metrics
tailored to various aspects of model performance. Here are some advanced metrics employed in LLM
evaluation:
Perplexity
Perplexity measures how well a probability distribution or model predicts a sample. In the context of
LLMs, it evaluates the model’s uncertainty about the next word in a sequence. Lower perplexity indicates
better performance, as the model is more confident in its predictions.
57
Factuality
Factuality assesses the accuracy of the information produced by the LLM. It is particularly important for
applications where misinformation could have serious consequences. Higher factuality scores correlate
with higher output quality.
LLM Uncertainty
LLM uncertainty is measured using log probability, helping to identify low-quality generations. Lower
uncertainty indicates higher output quality. This metric leverages the log probability of each generated
token, providing insights into the model’s confidence in its responses.
Prompt Perplexity
This metric evaluates how well the model understands the input prompt.
Lower prompt perplexity
indicates a clear and comprehensible prompt, which is likely to yield better model performance.
Context Relevance
In retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, context relevance measures how pertinent the re-
trieved context is to the user query. Higher context relevance improves the quality of generated responses
by ensuring that the model utilises the most relevant information.
Completeness
Completeness assesses whether the model’s response fully addresses the query based on the provided
context. High completeness ensures that all relevant information is included in the response, enhancing
its utility and accuracy.
Chunk Attribution and Utilisation
These metrics evaluate how effectively the retrieved chunks of information contribute to the final response.
Higher chunk attribution and utilisation scores indicate that the model is efficiently using the available
context to generate accurate and relevant answers.
Data Error Potential
This metric quantifies the difficulty the model faces in learning from the training data. Higher data
quality results in lower error potential, leading to better model performance.
Safety Metrics
Safety metrics ensure that the LLM’s outputs are appropriate and non-harmful. These are included in
the final sections of the chapter.
Integrating these advanced metrics provides a holistic view of LLM performance, enabling developers to
fine-tune and optimise models more effectively. By employing a metrics-first approach, it is possible to
ensure that LLMs not only produce accurate and high-quality outputs but also do so consistently and
reliably across diverse applications1.
7.3
Understanding the Training Loss Curve
The training loss curve plots the loss value against training epochs and is essential for monitoring model
performance.
1https://www.rungalileo.io/blog/metrics-first-approach-to-llm-evaluation
58
7.3.1
Interpreting Loss Curves
An ideal training loss curve shows a rapid decrease in loss during initial stages, followed by a gradual
decline and eventual plateau. Specific patterns to look for include:
1. Underfitting: High loss value that does not decrease significantly over time, suggesting the model
cannot learn the data.
2. Overfitting: Decreasing training loss with increasing validation loss, indicating the model mem-
orises the training data.
3. Fluctuations: Significant variations may indicate a high learning rate or noisy gradients.
Figure 7.1: Example training loss curve showing the decline in loss over iterations during the fine-tuning
of Llama2 13B on a financial Q/A dataset. The curve illustrates the effectiveness of the fine-tuning
process in reducing the loss and improving model performance.
7.3.2
Avoiding Overfitting
Techniques to prevent overfitting include:
1. Regularisation: Adds a penalty term to the loss function to encourage smaller weights.
2. Early Stopping: Stops training when validation performance no longer improves.
3. Dropout: Randomly deactivates neurons during training to reduce sensitivity to noise.
4. Cross-Validation: Splits data into multiple subsets for training and validation to assess model
generalisation.
5. Batch Normalisation: Normalises inputs to each layer during training to stabilise the learning
process.
6. Larger Datasets and Batch Sizes: Reduces overfitting by increasing the amount of diverse
data and batch sizes.
59
7.3.3
Sources of Noisy Gradients
Noisy gradients are common during the training of machine learning models, including LLMs. They arise
from variability in gradient estimates due to stochastic gradient descent and its variants. Strategies to
manage noisy gradients include:
1. Learning Rate Scheduling: Gradually decreasing the learning rate during training can reduce
the impact of noisy gradients.
2. Gradient Clipping: Setting a threshold for gradient values prevents large updates that can
destabilise training.
7.4
Running Validation Loops
Validation loops provide an unbiased evaluation of model performance. Typical steps include:
1. Split Data: Divide the dataset into training and validation sets.
2. Initialise Validation: Evaluate the model on the validation set at the end of each epoch.
3. Calculate Metrics: Compute relevant performance metrics, such as cross-entropy loss.
4. Record Results: Log validation metrics for each epoch.
5. Early Stopping: Optionally stop training if validation loss does not improve for a predefined
number of epochs.
7.5
Monitoring and Interpreting Results
Monitoring validation results involves analysing trends in validation metrics over epochs. Key aspects
include:
1. Consistent Improvement: Indicates good model generalisation if both training and validation
metrics improve and plateau.
2. Divergence: Suggests overfitting if training metrics improve while validation metrics deteriorate.
3. Stability: Ensure validation metrics do not fluctuate significantly, indicating stable training.
7.6
Hyperparameter Tuning and Other Adjustments
Fine-tuning involves adjusting key hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance. Important hyper-
parameters include:
1. Learning Rate: Determines the step size for updating model weights. A good starting point is
2e-4, but this can vary.
2. Batch Size: Larger batch sizes lead to more stable updates but require more memory.
3. Number of Training Epochs: Balancing the number of epochs ensures the model learns suffi-
ciently without overfitting or underfitting.
4. Optimiser: Optimisers like Paged ADAM optimise memory usage, advantageous for large models.
Other tunable parameters include dropout rate, weight decay, and warmup steps.
7.6.1
Data Size and Quality
The efficacy of LLMs is directly impacted by the quality of their training data. Ensuring that datasets
are clean, relevant, and adequate is crucial. Data cleanliness refers to the absence of noise, errors, and
inconsistencies within the labelled data. For example, having a phrase like “This article suggests. . . ”
multiple times in the training data can corrupt the response of LLMs and add a bias towards using this
specific phrase more often and in inappropriate situations.
60
7.7
Benchmarking Fine-Tuned LLMs
Modern LLMs are assessed using standardised benchmarks such as GLUE, SuperGLUE, HellaSwag,

As LLMs evolve, so do benchmarks, with new standards such as BigCodeBench challenging current
benchmarks and setting new standards in the domain. Given the diverse nature of LLMs and the tasks
they can perform, the choice of benchmarks depends on the specific tasks the LLM is expected to handle.
For generic applicability, various benchmarks for different downstream applications and reasoning should
be utilised. For domain/task-specific LLMs, benchmarking can be limited to relevant benchmarks like
BigCodeBench for coding.

Evaluating Fine-Tuned LLMs on Safety Benchmark
The safety aspects of Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly scrutinised due to their ability
to generate harmful content when influenced by jailbreaking prompts. These prompts can bypass the
embedded safety and ethical guidelines within the models, similar to code injection techniques used in
traditional computer security to circumvent safety protocols. Notably, models like ChatGPT, GPT-
3, and InstructGPT are vulnerable to such manipulations that remove content generation restrictions,
potentially violating OpenAI’s guidelines. This underscores the necessity for robust safeguards to ensure
LLM outputs adhere to ethical and safety standards.
DecodingTrust [79] provides a comprehensive evaluation of the trustworthiness of LLMs, notably com-
paring GPT-4 with GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT). This evaluation spans several critical areas:
1. Toxicity: Optimisation algorithms and generative models are employed to create challenging
prompts that test the model’s ability to avoid generating harmful content.
2. Stereotype Bias: An array of demographic groups and stereotype topics are utilised to assess
model bias, helping to understand and mitigate prejudiced responses.
3. Adversarial Robustness: The resilience of models against adversarial attacks is tested by chal-
lenging them with sophisticated algorithms intended to deceive or mislead.
4. Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Robustness: Models are evaluated on their ability to handle
inputs that differ significantly from their training data, such as poetic or Shakespearean styles.
5. Robustness to Adversarial Demonstrations: Demonstrations that contain misleading infor-
mation are used to test the model’s robustness across various tasks.
6. Privacy: Various levels of privacy evaluation assess how well models safeguard sensitive informa-
tion during interactions and understand privacy-related contexts.
7. Hallucination Detection: Identifies instances where the model generates information not grounded
in the provided context or factual data. Lower hallucination rates improve the reliability and trust-
worthiness of the LLM’s outputs.
8. Tone Appropriateness: Assesses whether the model’s output maintains an appropriate tone for
the given context. This is particularly important for applications in customer service, healthcare,
and other sensitive areas.
9. Machine Ethics: Ethical assessments involve testing models with scenarios that require moral
judgments, using datasets like ETHICS and Jiminy Cricket.
10. Fairness: The fairness of models is evaluated by generating tasks that vary protected attributes,
ensuring equitable responses across different demographic groups.
The dataset employed for evaluating the aforementioned eight safety dimensions can be found here.
In partnership with HuggingFace, the LLM Safety Leaderboard utilises DecodingTrust’s framework to
provide a unified evaluation platform for LLM safety.
This allows researchers and practitioners to
better understand the capabilities, limitations, and risks associated with LLMs. Users are encouraged to
submit their models to HuggingFace for evaluation, ensuring they meet the evolving standards of safety
and reliability in the field.

misinformation, and explicit content. The model’s scalability, with options ranging from 2B to 27B
parameters, allows for tailored applications that meet specific needs, such as reducing latency in online
safety applications or enhancing performance in complex decision-making tasks.
A distinguishing feature of ShieldGemma is its novel approach to data curation. It leverages synthetic
data generation techniques to create high-quality datasets that are robust against adversarial prompts
and fair across diverse identity groups. This reduces the need for extensive human annotation, streamlin-
ing the data preparation process while ensuring the model’s effectiveness. Compared to existing content
moderation tools like LlamaGuard and WildGuard, which typically offer fixed-size models and limited
customisation, ShieldGemma’s flexible architecture and advanced data handling capabilities provide a
more adaptable and efficient solution.
These innovations position ShieldGemma as a significant ad-
vancement in LLM-based content moderation, offering developers and researchers a versatile tool that

WILDGUARD [82] is an innovative open-source tool developed to enhance the safety of interactions
with large language models (LLMs).
This tool addresses three critical moderation tasks: detecting
2https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModelForCausalLM
63
harmful intent in user prompts, identifying safety risks in model responses, and determining when a
model appropriately refuses unsafe requests.
Central to its development is WILDGUARD MIX3, a
meticulously curated dataset comprising 92,000 labelled examples that include both benign prompts and
adversarial attempts to bypass safety measures. The dataset is divided into WILDGUARD TRAIN, used
for training the model, and WILDGUARD TEST, consisting of high-quality human-annotated examples
for evaluation.
The WILDGUARD model itself is fine-tuned on the Mistral-7B language model using the WILDGUARD
TRAIN dataset, enabling it to perform all three moderation tasks in a unified, multi-task manner. Results
show that WILDGUARD surpasses existing open-source moderation tools in effectiveness, particularly
excelling in handling adversarial prompts and accurately detecting model refusals. On many benchmarks,
WILDGUARD’s performance is on par with or exceeds that of GPT-4, a much larger, closed-source
model.
The quick start guide and additional information on WILDGUARD are available in GitHub and it can

Stage 6: Deployment
8.1
Steps Involved in Deploying the Fine-Tuned Model
1. Model Export: Save the fine-tuned model in a suitable format (e.g., ONNX, TensorFlow Saved-
Model, PyTorch) for deployment.
2. Infrastructure Setup: Prepare the deployment environment, including necessary hardware, cloud
services, and containerisation tools.
3. API Development: Create APIs to allow applications to interact with the model, facilitating
prediction requests and responses.
4. Deployment: Deploy the model to the production environment, making it accessible to end-users
or applications.
8.2
Cloud-Based Providers for LLM Deployment
Cloud-based large language model (LLM) inferencing frequently employs a pricing model based on the
number of tokens processed. Users are charged according to the volume of text analysed or generated
by the model. While this pricing structure can be cost-effective for sporadic or small-scale usage, it may
not always be economical for larger or continuous workloads.
In some scenarios, hosting an LLM solution in-house may offer better long-term cost savings, especially if
there is consistent or high-volume usage. Managing your own infrastructure provides greater control over
resource allocation and allows for cost optimisation based on specific needs. Additionally, self-hosting
offers advantages in terms of data privacy and security, as sensitive information remains within your own
environment.
However, it is crucial to carefully evaluate the total cost of ownership when comparing cloud-based
solutions with self-hosted alternatives. This evaluation should consider factors such as hardware expenses,
maintenance, and operational overheads. Ultimately, the decision should be informed by a comprehensive
cost-benefit analysis, considering both short-term affordability and long-term sustainability.

Techniques for Optimising Model Performance During In-
ference
Optimising model performance during inference is crucial for the efficient deployment of large language
models (LLMs). The following advanced techniques offer various strategies to enhance performance,
reduce latency, and manage computational resources effectively.
8.3.1
Traditional On-Premises GPU-Based Deployments
This conventional approach to deploying large language models (LLMs) involves using Graphics Process-
ing Units (GPUs) due to their parallel processing capabilities, which enable fast and efficient inference.
However, this method requires upfront hardware investment and may not be suitable for applications
with fluctuating demand or limited budgets. GPU-based deployments face several challenges:
1. Resource utilisation may suffer during periods of low demand due to idle servers.
2. Scaling up or down often requires physical hardware modifications, which can be time-consuming.
66
3. Centralised servers can introduce single points of failure and scalability limitations.
To mitigate these issues, strategies such as load balancing between multiple GPUs, fallback routing, model
parallelism, and data parallelism can be employed to achieve better results. Optimisation techniques like
distributed inference using PartialState from accelerate can further enhance efficiency.
Example use case: Large-Scale NLP Application
For instance, a large e-commerce platform implemented traditional on-premises GPU-based deployment
to handle millions of customer queries daily. By utilising load balancing and model parallelism, they
were able to achieve a significant reduction in latency and improved customer satisfaction.
8.3.2
Distributed LLM: Torrent-Style Deployment and Parallel Forward Passes
An innovative deployment strategy for large language models (LLMs) involves distributing them across
multiple GPUs in a decentralised, torrent-style manner. Libraries like Petals1 can perform this task.
Petals functions as a decentralised pipeline designed for rapid neural network inference by partitioning
the model into distinct blocks or layers, which are distributed across multiple geographically dispersed
servers. Users can connect their own GPUs to this network, acting as both contributors and clients who
can access and apply the model to their data.
When a client request is received, the network routes it through a series of servers optimised to minimise
the total forward pass time. Each server dynamically selects the most optimal set of blocks, adapting to
the current bottlenecks in the pipeline. This framework leverages decentralisation principles to distribute
computational load across diverse regions, sharing computational resources and GPUs in a way that
reduces the financial burden on individual organisations. This collaborative approach not only optimises
resource utilisation but also fosters a global community dedicated to shared AI goals.
Figure 8.1: Conceptual Representation of Distributed LLM Deployment Using a Torrent-Style Approach.
This figure illustrates the distributed deployment of a Large Language Model (LLM) using a torrent-style
approach, where multiple GPT model layers (stacks) are distributed across different nodes (represented
by chefs) and perform parallel forward passes. The process mimics the flow of orders from customers
(input data) through restaurants (intermediate processing layers) to chefs (model layers), highlighting
the efficiency of parallel processing and distributed computing in handling large-scale language models.
This approach is essential for reducing inference latency and improving the scalability of LLMs across
diverse computational environments. (adapted from [83])

67
Example use case: Global Research Collaboration
A consortium of research institutions implemented a distributed LLM using the Petals framework to
analyse large datasets across different continents. By leveraging the decentralised nature of Petals, they
achieved high efficiency in processing and collaborative model development.
8.3.3
WebGPU-Based Deployment of LLM
This deployment option for large language models (LLMs) involves utilising WebGPU, a web standard
that provides a low-level interface for graphics and compute applications on the web platform. With
WebGPU, organisations can harness the power of GPUs directly within web browsers, enabling effi-
cient inference for LLMs in web-based applications. WebGPU enables high-performance computing and
graphics rendering directly within the client’s web browser. It allows developers to utilise the client’s
GPU for tasks such as rendering graphics, accelerating computational workloads, and performing par-
allel processing, all without the need for plugins or additional software installations. This capability
permits complex computations to be executed efficiently on the client’s device, leading to faster and
more responsive web applications.
8.3.4
LLM on WebGPU using WebLLM
Clients can access powerful large language models and chatbots directly in their browser, leveraging
WebGPU acceleration. This approach eliminates server dependencies, providing users with exceptional
performance and enhanced privacy. WebLLM facilitates the use of large language models directly in the
client’s browser to perform tasks such as filtering out personally identifiable information (PII) or named
entity recognition (NER) on data without transmitting it over the network.
This ensures enhanced
privacy and security by retaining sensitive information on the client side.
68
Figure 8.2: WebGPU-Based Deployment of LLM: This diagram illustrates the architecture of deploying
a large language model (LLM) using WebGPU technology. The CPU manages the distribution of prompt
inferencing tasks to multiple GPUs, which then process these prompts in parallel, enhancing efficiency
and scalability in LLM deployment across web-based platforms. (adapted from [83])
Additional Use Cases for WebLLM
1. Language Translation: Enable real-time translation of text directly in the browser, allowing
users to communicate across language barriers without transmitting their messages over the net-
work.
2. Code Autocompletion: Develop code editors that provide intelligent autocompletion suggestions
based on context, leveraging WebLLM to understand and predict code snippets.
3. Customer Support Chatbots: Implement chatbots on websites to provide instant customer
support and answer frequently asked questions without relying on external servers.
4. Data Analysis and Visualisation: Create browser-based tools for analysing and visualising
data, with WebLLM assisting in data processing, interpretation, and generating insights.
5. Personalised Recommendations:
Develop recommendation engines that offer personalised
product recommendations, content suggestions, or movie/music recommendations based on user
preferences and behaviour.
6. Privacy-Preserving Analytics: Develop analytics platforms that perform data analysis directly
in the browser, ensuring that sensitive information remains on the client side and reducing the risk
of data breaches.
69
Example use case: Privacy-Focused Web Application
A healthcare startup deployed an LLM using WebLLM to process patient information directly within the
browser, ensuring data privacy and compliance with healthcare regulations. This approach significantly
reduced the risk of data breaches and improved user trust.
8.3.5
Quantised LLMs
Model quantisation is a technique utilised to reduce the size of an AI model by representing its parameters
with fewer bits. In traditional machine learning models, each parameter (e.g., weights and biases in neural
networks) is typically stored as a 32-bit floating-point number, necessitating significant memory and
computational resources, particularly for large models. Quantisation aims to alleviate this by reducing
the precision of these parameters. For instance, instead of storing each parameter as a 32-bit floating-
point number, they may be represented using fewer bits, such as 8-bit integers.
This compression
reduces the memory footprint of the model, making it more efficient to deploy and execute, especially in
resource-constrained environments like mobile devices or edge devices. QLoRA is a popular example of
this quantisation for LLMs and can be used to deploy LLMs locally or host them on external servers.
Example use case: Edge Device Deployment
A tech company used quantised LLMs to deploy advanced NLP models on mobile devices, enabling offline
functionality for applications such as voice recognition and translation. This deployment significantly
improved app performance and user experience by reducing latency and reliance on internet connectivity.
8.3.6
vLLMs
The vLLM2 system efficiently handles requests by employing a block-level memory management method
and preemptive request scheduling. It utilises the PagedAttention[84] algorithm to manage the key-
value (KV) cache, thereby reducing memory waste and fragmentation. By batching requests and sharing
physical blocks across multiple samples, vLLM optimises memory usage and enhances throughput. Per-
formance tests indicate that vLLM surpasses other systems in various decoding scenarios. Consider a
transformer-based model tasked with summarising a lengthy book. Traditional transformers process the
entire book simultaneously, which can be both computationally and memory-intensive, especially for ex-
tended texts. With PagedAttention, the book is divided into smaller segments or pages. The model then
focuses on summarising one page at a time, rather than the entire book simultaneously. This approach
reduces computational complexity and memory requirements, making it more feasible to process and
summarise lengthy texts efficiently.
Example use case: High-Volume Content Generation
A content marketing agency implemented vLLMs for generating large volumes of SEO-optimised content.
By leveraging the efficient memory management of vLLMs, they were able to handle multiple concurrent
requests, significantly increasing their content production rate while maintaining high quality.
8.4
Key Considerations for Deployment of LLMs
Deploying large language models (LLMs) effectively requires careful planning and consideration of various
factors to ensure optimal performance, cost-efficiency, and security. Key considerations include:
• Infrastructure Requirements:
– Compute Resources: Ensure adequate CPU/GPU resources to handle the model’s compu-
tational demands. High-performance GPUs are typically required for efficient inference and
training.

Stage 7: Monitoring and
Maintenance
9.1
Steps Involved in Monitoring and Maintenance of Deployed
Fine-Tuned LLMs
Continuous monitoring and maintenance of fine-tuned LLMs are essential to ensure their optimal per-
formance, accuracy, and security over time. Below are the key steps involved in this process:
1. Setup Initial Baselines: Establish initial performance baselines by evaluating the model on a
comprehensive test dataset. Record metrics such as accuracy, latency, throughput, and error rates
to serve as reference points for future monitoring.
2. Performance Monitoring: Implement systems to continuously track key performance metrics
such as response time, server load, and token usage. Regularly compare these metrics against the
established baselines to detect any deviations.
3. Accuracy Monitoring: Continuously evaluate the model’s predictions against a ground truth
dataset. Use metrics like precision, recall, F1 score, and cross-entropy loss to ensure the model
maintains high accuracy levels.
4. Error Monitoring: Track and analyse errors, including runtime errors and prediction errors.
Implement logging mechanisms to capture detailed information about each error for troubleshooting
and improvement.
5. Log Analysis: Maintain comprehensive logs for each prediction request and response, including
input data, output predictions, response times, and encountered errors. Regularly review logs to
identify patterns and areas for improvement.
6. Alerting Mechanisms: Set up automated alerting systems to notify stakeholders of any anomalies
or deviations from expected performance metrics. Integrate alerts with communication tools like
Slack, PagerDuty, or email for timely responses.
7. Feedback Loop: Establish a feedback loop with end-users to gather insights on model performance
and user satisfaction. Use this feedback to continuously refine and improve the model.
8. Security Monitoring: Implement robust security measures to monitor for threats, including
unauthorised access, data breaches, and adversarial attacks. Use encryption, access control, and
regular security audits to protect the model and data.
9. Drift Detection: Continuously monitor for data and concept drift using statistical tests and
drift detectors. Regularly evaluate the model on holdout datasets to detect changes in input data
distribution or model performance.
10. Model Versioning: Maintain version control for different iterations of the model. Track perfor-
mance metrics for each version to ensure that the best-performing model is in production.
72
11. Documentation and Reporting: Keep detailed documentation of monitoring procedures, met-
rics, and findings. Generate regular reports to provide stakeholders with insights into the model’s
performance and maintenance activities.
12. Periodic Review and Update: Regularly assess and update the monitoring processes to incor-
porate new techniques, tools, and best practices, ensuring the monitoring system remains effective
and up-to-date.
9.2
Continuous Monitoring of Model Performance
While large language model (LLM) applications undergo some form of evaluation, continuous monitoring
remains inadequately implemented in most cases. This section outlines the components necessary to
establish an effective monitoring programme aimed at safeguarding users and preserving brand integrity.
9.2.1
Functional Monitoring
Initially, it is crucial to monitor fundamental metrics consistently. This includes tracking metrics such
as request volume, response times, token utilisation, costs incurred, and error rates.
9.2.2
Prompt Monitoring
Following functional metrics, attention should be directed towards monitoring user-generated prompts
or inputs. Metrics like readability can provide valuable insights. LLM evaluators should be employed to
detect potential toxicity in responses. Additionally, metrics such as embedding distances from reference
prompts prove insightful, ensuring adaptability to varying user interactions over time.
Introducing a new evaluation category involves identifying adversarial attempts or malicious prompt
injections, often overlooked in initial evaluations. Comparison against reference sets of known adversarial
prompts helps identify and flag malicious activities. Evaluative LLMs play a crucial role in classifying
prompts as benign or malicious.
9.2.3
Response Monitoring
Monitoring responses involves several critical checks to ensure alignment with expected outcomes. Pa-
rameters such as relevance, coherence (hallucination), topical alignment, sentiment, and their evolution
over time are essential. Metrics related to toxicity and harmful output require frequent monitoring due
to their critical impact. Prompt leakage represents an adversarial tactic wherein sensitive prompt in-
formation is illicitly extracted from the application’s stored data. Monitoring responses and comparing
them against the database of prompt instructions can help detect such breaches. Embedding distance
metrics are particularly effective in this regard. Regular testing against evaluation datasets provides
benchmarks for accuracy and highlights any performance drift over time. Tools capable of managing
embeddings allow exportation of underperforming output datasets for targeted improvements.
9.2.4
Alerting Mechanisms and Thresholds
Effective monitoring necessitates well-calibrated alerting thresholds to avoid excessive false alarms. Im-
plementing multivariate drift detection and alerting mechanisms can enhance accuracy. Consideration
of false alarm rates and best practices for setting thresholds is paramount for effective monitoring sys-
tem design. Alerting features should include integration with communication tools such as Slack and
PagerDuty. Some systems offer automated response blocking in case of alerts triggered by problematic
prompts. Similar mechanisms can be employed to screen responses for personal identifiable information
(PII), toxicity, and other quality metrics before delivery to users. Custom metrics tailored to specific
application nuances or innovative insights from data scientists can significantly enhance monitoring ef-
ficacy. Flexibility to incorporate such metrics is essential to adapt to evolving monitoring needs and
advancements in the field.
73
9.2.5
Monitoring User Interface (UI)
The monitoring system’s UI is pivotal, typically featuring time-series graphs of monitored metrics. Dif-
ferentiated UIs facilitate in-depth analysis of alert trends, aiding root cause analysis.
Advanced UI
capabilities may include visualisations of embedding spaces through clustering and projections, provid-
ing insights into data patterns and relationships. Mature monitoring systems categorise data by users,
projects, and teams, ensuring role-based access control (RBAC) to protect sensitive information. Op-
timising alert analysis within the UI interface remains an area where improvements can significantly
reduce false alarm rates and enhance operational efficiency.
9.3
Updating LLM Knowledge
To improve the knowledge base of an LLM, continued pretraining is used to help LLM evolve with the
latest knowledge and information. The world and language are constantly evolving. New information
emerges, trends shift, and cultural references change. LLMs trained on static data can become outdated,
leading to:
• Factual Errors: Outdated information can cause LLMs to provide inaccurate responses.
• Irrelevance: Models might miss the context of current events or use outdated references.
• Bias Perpetuation: Biases present in training data can become entrenched if not addressed
through updates.
9.3.1
Retraining Methods
• Periodic Retraining: This involves refreshing the model’s knowledge base at regular intervals
(weekly, monthly, yearly) with new data. This is a straightforward method but requires a steady
stream of high-quality, unbiased data.
• Trigger-Based Retraining: This approach monitors the LLM’s performance. When metrics like
accuracy or relevance fall below a certain threshold, a retraining process is triggered. This method
is more dynamic but requires robust monitoring systems and clear performance benchmarks.
9.3.2
Additional Methods
• Fine-Tuning: LLMs can be fine-tuned for specific tasks by training them on smaller, domain-
specific datasets. This allows for specialisation without complete retraining.
• Active Learning: This approach involves selectively querying the LLM to identify areas where
it lacks knowledge. The retrieved information is then used to update the model.
9.3.3
Key Considerations
• Data Quality and Bias: New training data must be carefully curated to ensure quality and
mitigate bias. Techniques like human annotation and fairness checks are crucial.
• Computational Cost: Retraining LLMs can be computationally expensive, requiring significant
resources. Optimisations like transfer learning (using pre-trained models as a starting point) can
help reduce costs.
• Downtime: Retraining often takes time, leading to LLM downtime. Strategies like rolling updates
or deploying multiple models can minimise service disruptions.
• Version Control: Tracking different versions of the LLM and their training data is essential for
rollbacks in case of performance issues.
74
9.4
The Future of LLM Updates
Research is ongoing to develop more efficient and effective LLM update strategies. One promising area
is continuous learning, where LLMs can continuously learn and adapt from new data streams without
retraining from scratch. Continuous learning aims to reduce the need for frequent full-scale retraining by
enabling models to update incrementally with new information. This approach can significantly enhance
the model’s ability to remain current with evolving knowledge and language use, improving its long-term
performance and relevance.
Innovations in transfer learning and meta-learning are also contributing to advancements in LLM updates.
These techniques allow models to leverage pre-existing knowledge and adapt quickly to new tasks or
domains with minimal additional training.
By integrating these advanced learning methods, future
LLMs can become more adaptable and efficient in processing and understanding new information.
Furthermore, ongoing improvements in hardware and computational resources will support more frequent
and efficient updates. As processing power increases and becomes more accessible, the computational
burden of updating large models will decrease, enabling more regular and comprehensive updates.
Collaboration between academia and industry is vital in driving these advancements. By sharing research
findings and best practices, the field can collectively move towards more robust and efficient LLM update
methodologies, ensuring that models remain accurate, relevant, and valuable over time.

and Frameworks for LLMs
The evolution of fine-tuning techniques has been propelled by leading tech companies and platforms that
have introduced innovative frameworks and services. Companies like HuggingFace, Amazon Web Services
(AWS), Microsoft Azure, and OpenAI have developed tools and platforms that simplify and democratise
the fine-tuning process. These advancements have not only lowered the barrier to entry for leveraging
state-of-the-art AI models but have also enabled a wide range of applications across various industries,
from healthcare and finance to customer service and content creation. Each of these platforms offers
unique capabilities that cater to different needs, whether it be through automated fine-tuning workflows,
scalable cloud-based training environments, or accessible API interfaces for deploying custom models.
HuggingFace, for example, has made significant strides with its Transformers library1 and tools like Au-
totrain2 and SetFit, which allow users to fine-tune models with minimal coding and data. Their platform
provides a robust infrastructure that supports both the research community and industry practitioners,
facilitating the rapid development and deployment of custom AI solutions. Similarly, AWS’s SageMaker3
and SetFit4 provides an extensive suite of services that cover the entire machine learning lifecycle, from
data preparation and training to model deployment and optimisation, making it a comprehensive solu-
tion for enterprise-level applications.
On the other hand, Microsoft Azure integrates its fine-tuning capabilities with enterprise-grade tools
and services, offering solutions like Azure Machine Learning and the Azure OpenAI Service that cater to
large organisations looking to incorporate advanced AI into their operations. Azure’s focus on MLOps
and seamless integration with other Azure services ensures that fine-tuned models can be efficiently de-
ployed and maintained in production environments. Meanwhile, OpenAI has pioneered the concept of
”fine-tuning as a service” allowing businesses to leverage their powerful models like GPT-4 through a
user-friendly API 5, enabling custom model adaptations without the need for in-house AI expertise or
infrastructure.
The collective efforts of these tech companies have not only enhanced the efficiency and scalability of
fine-tuning but also democratised access to sophisticated AI tools. By reducing the technical barriers
and providing comprehensive, user-friendly platforms, these innovations have enabled a wider range of
industries to deploy advanced AI models tailored to their specific needs. Tables 10.1 and 10.2 offer a
quick comparison of LLM fine-tuning tools and frameworks from different providers.

10.1
Autotrain
Autotrain is HuggingFace’s innovative platform that automates the fine-tuning of large language models,
making it accessible even to those with limited machine learning expertise. The complexity and resource
demands of fine-tuning LLMs can be daunting, but Autotrain simplifies the process by handling the most
challenging aspects, such as data preparation, model configuration, and hyperparameter optimisation.
This automation is particularly valuable for small teams or individual developers who need to deploy
custom LLMs quickly and efficiently.
10.1.1
Steps Involved in Fine-Tuning Using Autotrain
Following are the steps involved in fine-tuning LLMs using Autotrain. Figure 10.1 represents the visual
workflow.
• Dataset Upload and Model Selection:
78
Figure 10.1: Overview of the Autotrain Workflow. This diagram illustrates the step-by-step process
within the Autotrain system, beginning with the upload of datasets and model selection by users. The
workflow then moves to data preparation and model configuration, followed by automated hyperpa-
rameter tuning to optimise model performance. The fine-tuning phase adjusts the model based on the
provided datasets, culminating in the deployment of the fully fine-tuned model for practical use.
– Users begin by uploading their datasets to the Autotrain platform.
– They then select a pre-trained model from the extensive HuggingFace Model Hub.
• Data Preparation:
– Autotrain automatically processes the uploaded data, including tasks like tokenization to
convert text into a format the LLM can understand.
• Model Configuration:
– The platform configures the model for fine-tuning, setting up the training environment and
necessary parameters.
• Automated Hyperparameter Tuning:
– Autotrain explores various hyperparameter configurations (such as learning rate, batch size,
and sequence length) and selects the best-performing ones.
• Fine-Tuning:
– The model is fine-tuned on the prepared data with the optimised hyperparameters.
• Deployment:
– Once fine-tuning is complete, the model is ready for deployment in various NLP applications,
such as text generation, completion, and language translation.
79
10.1.2
Best Practices of Using Autotrain
• Data Quality: Ensure high-quality, well-labelled data for better model performance.
• Model Selection: Choose pre-trained models that are well-suited to your specific task to minimize
fine-tuning effort.
• Hyperparameter Optimisation: Leverage Autotrain’s automated hyperparameter tuning to
achieve optimal performance without manual intervention.
10.1.3
Challenges of Using Autotrain
• Data Privacy: Ensuring the privacy and security of sensitive data during the fine-tuning process.
• Resource Constraints: Managing computational resources effectively, especially in environments
with limited access to powerful hardware.
• Model Overfitting: Avoiding overfitting by ensuring diverse and representative training data
and using appropriate regularization techniques.
10.1.4
When to Use Autotrain
1. Lack of Deep Technical Expertise: Ideal for individuals or small teams without extensive
machine learning or LLM background who need to fine-tune models quickly and effectively.
2. Quick Prototyping and Deployment: Suitable for rapid development cycles where time is
critical, such as proof-of-concept projects or MVPs.
3. Resource-Constrained Environments: Useful for scenarios with limited computational re-
sources or where a quick turnaround is necessary.
In summary, Autotrain is an excellent tool for quick, user-friendly fine-tuning of LLMs for standard NLP
tasks, especially in environments with limited resources or expertise. However, it may not be suitable
for highly specialised applications or those requiring significant customisation and scalability.

10.2
Transformers Library and Trainer API
The Transformers Library by HuggingFace stands out as a pivotal tool for fine-tuning large language
models (LLMs) such as BERT, GPT-3, and GPT-4. This comprehensive library offers a wide array of
pre-trained models tailored for various LLM tasks, making it easier for users to adapt these models to
specific needs with minimal effort. Whether you’re fine-tuning for tasks like sentiment analysis, text
classification, or generating customer support responses, the library simplifies the process by allowing
seamless model selection from the HuggingFace Model Hub and straightforward customisation through
its high-level APIs.
Central to the fine-tuning process within the Transformers Library is the Trainer API. This API includes
the Trainer class, which automates and manages the complexities of fine-tuning LLMs. After completing
data preprocessing, the Trainer class streamlines the setup for model training, including data handling,
optimisation, and evaluation. Users only need to configure a few parameters, such as learning rate and
batch size, and the API takes care of the rest. However, it’s crucial to note that running Trainer.train()
can be resource-intensive and slow on a CPU. For efficient training, a GPU or TPU is recommended.
Platforms like Google Colab provide free access to these resources, making it feasible for users without
high-end hardware to fine-tune models effectively.
80
The Trainer API also supports advanced features like distributed training and mixed precision, which
are essential for handling the large-scale computations required by modern LLMs. Distributed training
allows the fine-tuning process to be scaled across multiple GPUs or nodes, significantly reducing training
time. Mixed precision training, on the other hand, optimises memory usage and computation speed by
using lower precision arithmetic without compromising model performance. HuggingFace’s dedication to
accessibility is evident in the extensive documentation and community support they offer, enabling users
of all expertise levels to fine-tune LLMs. This democratisation of advanced NLP technology empowers
developers and researchers to deploy sophisticated, fine-tuned models for a wide range of applications,
from specialised language understanding to large-scale data processing.
10.2.1
Limitations of the Transformers Library and Trainer API
• Limited Customisation for Advanced Users: While the Trainer API simplifies many aspects
of training, it might not offer the deep customisation that advanced users or researchers might need
for novel or highly specialised applications.
• Learning Curve: Despite the simplified API, there is still a learning curve associated with un-
derstanding and effectively using the Transformers Library and Trainer API, particularly for those
new to NLP and LLM.
• Integration Limitations: The seamless integration and ease of use are often tied to the Hug-
gingFace ecosystem, which might not be compatible with all workflows or platforms outside their
environment.
In summary, the Transformers Library and Trainer API provide robust, scalable solutions for fine-tuning
LLMs across a range of applications, offering ease of use and efficient training capabilities. However, users
must be mindful of the resource requirements and potential limitations in customisation and complexity
management.
10.3
Optimum: Enhancing LLM Deployment Efficiency
Optimum6 is HuggingFace’s tool designed to optimise the deployment of large language models (LLMs)
by enhancing their efficiency across various hardware platforms. As LLMs grow in size and complexity,
deploying them in a cost-effective and performant manner becomes increasingly challenging. Optimum
addresses these challenges by applying a range of hardware-specific optimisations, such as quantisation,
pruning, and model distillation, which reduce the model’s size and improve inference speed without
significantly affecting accuracy. The following are the key techniques supported by Optimum:
• Quantisation: Quantisation is one of the key techniques supported by Optimum. This process in-
volves converting the model’s weights from high-precision floating-point numbers to lower-precision
formats, such as int8 or float16. This reduction in precision decreases the model’s memory foot-
print and computational requirements, enabling faster execution and lower power consumption,
especially on edge devices and mobile platforms. Optimum automates the quantisation process,
making it accessible to users who may not have expertise in low-level hardware optimisation.
• Pruning: Pruning is another critical optimisation strategy offered by Optimum. It involves iden-
tifying and removing less significant weights from the LLM, reducing its overall complexity and
size. This leads to faster inference times and lower storage needs, which are particularly beneficial
for deploying models in environments with limited computational resources. Optimum’s pruning
algorithms carefully eliminate these redundant weights while maintaining the model’s performance,
ensuring that it continues to deliver high-quality results even after optimisation.
• Model Distillation: In addition to these techniques, Optimum supports model distillation, a
process where a smaller, more efficient model is trained to replicate the behaviour of a larger, more
complex model. This distilled model retains much of the knowledge and capabilities of the original
while being significantly lighter and faster. Optimum provides tools to facilitate the distillation
process, allowing users to create compact LLMs that are well-suited for real-time applications. By
offering a comprehensive suite of optimisation tools, Optimum ensures that HuggingFace’s LLMs
can be deployed effectively across a wide range of environments, from powerful cloud servers to
resource-constrained edge devices.

81
10.3.1
Best Practices of Using Optimum
• Understand Hardware Requirements: Assess the target deployment environment (e.g., edge
devices, cloud servers) to optimise model configuration accordingly.
• Iterative Optimisation: Experiment with different optimisation techniques (quantisation levels,
pruning thresholds) to find the optimal balance between model size, speed, and accuracy.
• Validation and Testing: Validate optimised models thoroughly to ensure they meet performance
and accuracy requirements across different use cases.
• Documentation and Support: Refer to HuggingFace’s resources for detailed guidance on using
Optimum’s tools effectively, and leverage community support for troubleshooting and best practices
sharing.
• Continuous Monitoring: Monitor deployed models post-optimisation to detect any performance
degradation and adjust optimisation strategies as needed to maintain optimal performance over
time.

Customising Large Language Models (LLMs)
While general-purpose LLMs, enhanced with prompt engineering or light fine-tuning, have enabled organ-
isations to achieve successful proof-of-concept projects, transitioning to production presents additional
challenges.
Figure 10.3 illustrates NVIDIA’s detailed LLM customisation lifecycle, offering valuable
guidance for organisations that are preparing to deploy customised models in a production environment
[87].
1. Model Selection or Development
NVIDIA provides a range of pre-trained models, from 8B to 43B parameters, and supports the
integration of other open-source models of any size. Alternatively, users can develop their own
models, starting with data curation, which includes selecting, labeling, cleansing, validating, and
integrating data. This process, better termed data engineering, involves additional analysis, de-
signing storage, evaluating model training results, and incorporating reinforcement learning with
human feedback (RLHF). While building a custom foundation model is often costly, complex, and
time-consuming, most enterprises opt to start with a pre-trained model and focus on customisation.
87
Figure 10.3: Nvidia NeMo Framework for Customising and Deploying LLMs. The Nvidia NeMo frame-
work is designed for end-to-end customisation and deployment of large language models (LLMs). This
diagram illustrates the process from data curation and distributed training of foundation models, through
model customisation, to accelerated inference with guardrails. The platform enables AI developers to
integrate in-domain, secure, and cited responses into enterprise applications, ensuring that LLMs are
effectively tailored for specific tasks and industries. The NeMo framework, supported by Nvidia AI En-
terprise, also offers robust support for various pre-trained foundation models like OpenAI’s GPT family,
ensuring scalability and reliability in AI deployments. (adapted from [87])
2. Model Customisation
Model customisation involves optimising performance with task-specific datasets and adjusting
model weights. NeMo offers recipes for customisation, and enterprises can choose models already
tailored to specific tasks and then fine-tune them with proprietary data.
3. Inference
Inference refers to running models based on user queries. This phase involves considering hardware,
architecture, and performance factors that significantly impact usability and cost in production.
4. Guardrails
NVIDIA employs guardrails as intermediary services between models and applications.
These
services review incoming prompts for policy compliance, execute arbitration or orchestration steps,
and ensure model responses adhere to policies. Guardrails help maintain relevance, accuracy, safety,
privacy, and security.
5. Applications
NVIDIA’s framework presents enterprise applications as LLM-ready, though this is not always
the case.
Existing applications may be connected to LLMs to enable new features.
However,
creating assistants for knowledge access or task execution often involves designing new applications
specifically for natural language interfaces.

Multimodal LLMs and their
Fine-tuning
A multimodal model is a machine learning model that can process information from various modalities,
such as images, videos, and text. For instance, Google’s multimodal model, Gemini[88], can analyse a
photo of a plate of cookies and produce a written recipe in response, and it can perform the reverse as well.
The difference between Generative AI and Multimodal AI is that generative AI refers to the use of
machine learning models to create new content, such as text, images, music, audio, and videos, typically
from a single type of input. Multimodal AI extends these generative capabilities by processing informa-
tion from multiple modalities, including images, videos, and text. This enables the AI to understand
and interpret different sensory modes, allowing users to input various types of data and receive a diverse
range of content types in return.
Figure 11.1: Timeline of Multimodal Model Developments — This figure illustrates the progression
of significant multimodal models, highlighting key releases from major tech companies and research
institutions from December 2023 to March 2024. The timeline showcases models like Google’s TinyGPT-
V and Gemini Nano, along with other innovations such as MoE-LLAVA, DeepSeek-VL, and LLAVA-
Gemma, indicating the rapid advancement in multimodal AI technologies (adapted from [89]).

11.1
Vision Language Model (VLMs)
Vision language models encompass multimodal models capable of learning from both images and text
inputs. They belong to the category of generative models that utilise image and text data to produce
textual outputs. These models, especially at larger scales, demonstrate strong zero-shot capabilities,
exhibit robust generalisation across various tasks, and effectively handle diverse types of visual data such
as documents and web pages. Typical applications include conversational interactions involving images,
image interpretation based on textual instructions, answering questions related to visual content, under-
standing documents, generating captions for images, and more. Certain advanced vision language models
can also understand spatial attributes within images. They can generate bounding boxes or segmentation
masks upon request to identify or isolate specific subjects, localise entities within images, or respond to
queries regarding their relative or absolute positions. The landscape of large vision language models is
characterised by considerable diversity in training data, image encoding techniques, and consequently,
their functional capabilities.
11.1.1
Architecture
Vision-language models adeptly integrate both visual and textual information, leveraging three funda-
mental components:
• Image Encoder: This component translates visual data (images) into a format that the model
can process.
• Text Encoder: Similar to the image encoder, this component converts textual data (words and
sentences) into a format the model can understand.
• Fusion Strategy: This component combines the information from both the image and text en-
coders, merging the two data types into a unified representation.
These elements work collaboratively, with the model’s learning process (loss functions) specifically tai-
lored to the architecture and learning strategy employed. Although the concept of vision-language mod-
els is not new, their construction has evolved significantly. Early models used manually crafted image
descriptions and pre-trained word vectors. Modern models, however, utilise transformers—an advanced
neural network architecture—for both image and text encoding. These encoders can learn features either
independently or jointly.
A crucial aspect of these models is pre-training. Before being applied to specific tasks, the models are
trained on extensive datasets using carefully selected objectives. This pre-training equips them with the
foundational knowledge required to excel in various downstream applications. Following is one of the
example architectures of VLMs.
11.1.2
Contrastive Learning
Contrastive learning is a technique that focuses on understanding the differences between data points. It
computes a similarity score between instances and aims to minimise contrastive loss, making it particu-
larly useful in semi-supervised learning where a limited number of labelled samples guide the optimisation
process to classify unseen data points.
How it works
For instance, to recognise a cat, contrastive learning compares a cat image with a similar cat image and
a dog image. The model learns to distinguish between a cat and a dog by identifying features such as
facial structure, body size, and fur. By determining which image is closer to the ”anchor” image, the
model predicts its class.
CLIP is a model that utilises contrastive learning to compute similarity between text and image embed-
dings through textual and visual encoders. It follows a three-step process for zero-shot predictions:
• Pre-training: Trains a text and image encoder to learn image-text pairs.
• Caption Conversion: Converts training dataset classes into captions.
• Zero-Shot Prediction: Estimates the best caption for a given input image based on learned
similarities.
90
Figure 11.2: Workflow of Contrastive Pre-Training for Multimodal Models. This figure illustrates the
process of contrastive pre-training where text and image encoders are trained to align representations
from both modalities. Step 1 involves contrastive pre-training by pairing text and image data, while
Step 2 showcases the creation of a dataset classifier using label text encoded by the text encoder. Step
3 demonstrates the model’s application for zero-shot prediction by leveraging the pre-trained text and
image encoders. This method enables the model to generalise across various tasks without requiring
task-specific fine-tuning (adopted from [90]).
11.2
Fine-tuning of multimodal models
For fine-tuning a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), PEFT techniques such as LoRA and
QLoRA can be utilised. The process of fine-tuning for multimodal applications is analogous to that for
large language models, with the primary difference being the nature of the input data. In addition to
LoRA, which employs matrix factorisation techniques to reduce the number of parameters, other tools
such as LLM-Adapters and (IA)³[91] can be effectively used. LLM-Adapters integrate various adapter
modules into the pre-trained model’s architecture, enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning for diverse
tasks by updating only the adapter parameters while keeping the base model parameters fixed. (IA)³,
or Infused Adapters by Inhibiting and Amplifying Inner Activations, enhances performance by learn-
ing vectors to weight model parameters through activation multiplications, supporting robust few-shot
performance and task mixing without manual adjustments. Moreover, dynamic adaptation techniques
like DyLoRA[92] allow for the training of low-rank adaptation blocks across different ranks, optimising
the learning process by sorting the representations during training. LoRA-FA[93], a variant of LoRA,
optimises the fine-tuning process by freezing the first low-rank matrix after initialisation and using it as a
random projection while training the other, thereby reducing the number of parameters by half without
compromising performance.
The Efficient Attention Skipping (EAS)[94] module introduces a novel parameter and computation-
efficient tuning method for MLLMs, aiming to maintain high performance while reducing parameter and
computation costs for downstream tasks. However, MemVP[95] critiques this approach, noting that it
still increases the input length of language models. To address this, MemVP integrates visual prompts
with the weights of Feed Forward Networks, thereby injecting visual knowledge to decrease training time
and inference latency, ultimately outperforming previous PEFT methods.
11.2.1
Full-parameter Fine-Tuning
Methods such as those introduced by LOMO[96] and MeZO[97] provide alternative solutions by focusing
on memory efficiency.
LOMO utilises a low-memory optimisation technique derived from Stochastic
Gradient Descent (SGD), reducing memory consumption typically associated with the ADAM optimiser.
MeZO, on the other hand, offers a memory-efficient optimiser that requires only two forward passes
to compute gradients, enabling comprehensive fine-tuning of large models with a memory footprint
equivalent to inference [89].
91
11.2.2
Case study of fine-tuning MLLMs for Medical domain
The following section provides a case study on fine-tuning MLLMs for the Visual Question Answering
(VQA) task. In this example, we present a PEFT for fine-tuning MLLM specifically designed for Med-
VQA applications. To ensure accurate performance measurement, human evaluations were conducted,
demonstrating that the model achieves an overall accuracy of 81.9% and surpasses the GPT-4v model
by a substantial margin of 26% in absolute accuracy on closed-ended questions.
The model consists of three components: the vision encoder, a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM)
for handling multimodal inputs and generating responses, and a single linear layer for projecting embed-
dings from the visual encoding space to the LLM space, as shown in figure 11.3.
The Vision Transformer (ViT) type backbone, EVA, encodes image tokens into visual embeddings,
with model weights remaining frozen during the fine-tuning process. The technique from MiniGPT-v2
is utilised, grouping four consecutive tokens into one visual embedding to efficiently reduce resource
consumption by concatenating on the embedding dimension.
These grouped visual tokens are then processed through the projection layer, resulting in embeddings
(length 4096) in the LLM space. A multimodal prompt template integrates both visual and question
information, which is input into the pre-trained LLM, LLaMA2-chat(7B), for answer generation. The
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) technique is applied for efficient fine-tuning, keeping the rest of the LLM
frozen during downstream fine-tuning. A beam search with a width of 1 is utilised.
Figure 11.3: Overview of Med VQA architecture integrating LoRA and a pre-trained LLM with a Vision
Encoder for medical visual question answering tasks. The architecture includes stages for processing
images and generating contextually relevant responses, demonstrating the integration of vision and lan-
guage models in a medical setting (adopted from [98]).
The multimodal prompt includes input images, questions, and a specific token for VQA tasks, following
the MiniGPT-v2 template. In Figure 11.3, the image features derived from linear projection are labelled
as ImageFeature, with the corresponding questions serving as text instructions. The special token [VQA]
is used as the task identifier, forming the complete multimodal instructional template:
92
[INST]<img><ImageFeature></img>[VQA] Instruction [/INST].
Model Training
Weights from MiniGPT-v2, pre-trained on general domain datasets, are further fine-tuned using multi-
modal medical datasets in two stages. The LoRA technique is employed for efficient fine-tuning, updating
only a small portion of the entire model, as detailed below:
• Fine-tuning with image captioning: During this stage, the model is fine-tuned using the ROCO
medical image-caption dataset, which contains medical image-caption pairs of varying lengths. The
prompt template used is <Img><ImageHere></Img>[caption] <instruction>, with the instruc-
tion prompt randomly selected from a pool of four candidates, such as “Briefly describe this image.”
During training, only the linear projection layer and the LoRA layer in the LLM are fine-tuned,
while other parts of the model remain frozen.
• Fine-tuning on VQA: In the second stage, the model is fine-tuned on the Med-VQA dataset,
VQA-RAD, which contains triplets of images, questions, and answers. Following the instruction
template proposed in MiniGPT-v2, the template used is: “[INST] <img><ImageFeature></img>[VQA]
Instruction [/INST]”, where the instruction prompt is: “Based on the image, respond to this
question with a short answer: question,” with question signifying the question corresponding to
the given medical image. The motivation for generating short answers is to validate against the
existing labelled data in VQA-RAD, where the answers are typically short in both open-ended and
closed-ended QA pairs. Similar to the first stage, the vision encoder and the LLM remain frozen
while only the linear projection and LoRA layers in the LLM are updated.

Applications of Multimodal models
1. Gesture Recognition - These models interpret and recognise human gestures, which is crucial
for sign language translation. Multimodal models facilitate inclusive communication by processing
gestures and converting them into text or speech.
2. Video Summarisation - Multimodal models can summarise lengthy videos by extracting key vi-
sual and audio elements. This capability streamlines content consumption, enables efficient content
browsing, and enhances video content management platforms.
3. DALL-E is a notable example of multimodal AI that generates images from textual descriptions.
This technology expands creative possibilities in content creation and visual storytelling, with
applications in art, design, advertising, and more.
4. Educational Tools - Multimodal models enhance learning experiences by providing interactive
educational content that responds to both visual and verbal cues from students. They are integral
to adaptive learning platforms that adjust content and difficulty based on student performance and
feedback.
5. Virtual Assistants - Multimodal models power virtual assistants by understanding and respond-
ing to voice commands while processing visual data for comprehensive user interaction. They are
essential for smart home automation, voice-controlled devices, and digital personal assistants.
11.4
Audio or Speech LLMs Or Large Audio Models
Audio or speech LLMs are models designed to understand and generate human language based on audio
inputs. They have applications in speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, and natural language
understanding tasks. These models are typically pre-trained on large datasets to learn generic language
patterns, which are then fine-tuned on specific tasks or domains to enhance performance.
Audio and Speech Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a significant advancement in the integration
of language processing with audio signals. These models leverage a robust Large Language Model as a
foundational backbone, which is enhanced to handle multimodal data through the inclusion of custom
audio tokens. This transformation allows the models to learn and operate within a shared multimodal
space, where both text and audio signals can be effectively processed.
93
Unlike text, which is inherently discrete, audio signals are continuous and need to be discretized into
manageable audio tokens. Techniques like HuBERT[99] and wav2vec[100] are employed for this purpose,
converting audio into a tokenized format that the LLM can process alongside text. The model, typically
autoregressive and decoder-based, is pre-trained using a combination of self-supervised tasks, such as
predicting masked tokens in interleaved text and audio, and supervised fine-tuning for specific tasks like
transcription or sentiment analysis. This capability to handle and generate audio and text simultane-
ously allows for a wide range of applications, from audio question answering to speech-based sentiment
detection, making Audio and Speech LLMs a versatile tool in multimodal AI. The figure 11.4 illustrates
an example of a multimodal Audio LM architecture. In this setup, a prompt provides instructions in
both text and audio formats. The audio is tokenized using an audio tokenizer. The multimodal model
then combines these text and audio tokens and generates spoken speech through a vocoder (also known
as a voice decoder).
Figure 11.4: Multimodal Audio-Text Language Model architecture that integrates text and audio in-
puts for advanced multimodal processing.
The architecture utilises text tokenizers and audio en-
coders/tokenizers to convert inputs into tokens, which are then processed by the audio-text LM. This
model supports both discrete and continuous speech processing and enables tasks such as sentiment anal-
ysis and response generation in natural language. The audio tokens are further refined using a vocoder,
while text tokens are detokenized to produce coherent text outputs (adapted from [101]).
94
Audio and speech LLMs like AudioPaLM[102], AudioLM[103], and various adaptations of models like
Whisper and LLaMA, integrate capabilities for understanding and generating audio data, including
speech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS), and speech-to-speech (STS) translation.
These models
have shown that LLMs, initially designed for text, can be effectively adapted for audio tasks through
sophisticated tokenization and fine-tuning techniques.
11.4.1
Tokenization and Preprocessing
A key aspect of adapting LLMs for audio is the tokenization of audio data into discrete representations
that the model can process. For instance, AudioLM and AudioPaLM utilise a combination of acoustic
and semantic tokens. Acoustic tokens capture the high-quality audio synthesis aspect, while semantic
tokens help maintain long-term structural coherence in the generated audio. This dual-token approach
allows the models to handle both the intricacies of audio waveforms and the semantic content of speech.
11.4.2
Fine-Tuning Techniques
Fine-tuning audio and speech LLMs typically involve several key strategies:
• Full Parameter Fine-Tuning: This involves updating all the model’s parameters during fine-
tuning. For instance, LauraGPT and SpeechGPT fine-tune all parameters to adapt pre-trained
text LLMs to various audio tasks, although this can be computationally expensive.
• Layer-Specific Fine-Tuning: Techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) update only spe-
cific layers or modules of the model. This method significantly reduces computational requirements
while still allowing effective adaptation. Models like Qwen-Audio leverage LoRA to fine-tune pre-
trained components for enhanced performance on speech recognition tasks.
• Component-Based Fine-Tuning: Recent models, such as those integrating the Whisper en-
coder, freeze certain parts of the model (like the speech encoder) and only fine-tune a linear
projector or specific adapters to align the speech and text modalities. This approach simplifies the
training process and enhances efficiency[104].
• Multi-Stage Fine-Tuning: Models like AudioPaLM perform multi-stage fine-tuning, starting
with a text-based pre-training phase, followed by fine-tuning on a mixture of tasks that include
both text and audio data. This staged approach leverages the strengths of pre-trained text models
while adapting them for multimodal tasks.
11.4.3
Fine-Tuning Whisper for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)
Whisper1 is an advanced Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model developed by OpenAI, designed
to convert spoken language into text. Built upon the powerful Transformer architecture, Whisper excels
at capturing and transcribing diverse speech patterns across various languages and accents.
Unlike
traditional ASR models that require extensive labelled data, Whisper leverages a vast dataset and self-
supervised learning, enabling it to perform robustly in noisy environments and handle a wide range of
speech variations. Its versatility and high accuracy make it an ideal choice for applications such as voice
assistants, transcription services, and multilingual speech recognition systems.
Why Fine-Tune Whisper?
Fine-tuning Whisper for specific ASR tasks can significantly enhance its performance in specialised
domains. Although Whisper is pre-trained on a large and diverse dataset, it might not fully capture
the nuances of specific vocabularies or accents present in niche applications. Fine-tuning allows Whisper
to adapt to particular audio characteristics and terminologies, leading to more accurate and reliable
transcriptions. This process is especially beneficial in industries with domain-specific jargon, like medical,
legal, or technical fields, where the generic model might struggle with specialised vocabulary.

95
Steps to Fine-Tune Whisper
• Data Collection and Preparation: Gather a sizable dataset that matches the target domain or
task. Ensure the dataset includes diverse examples with clear transcriptions. Clean and preprocess
the audio files and transcripts, ensuring they are in a consistent format and aligned correctly. Tools
like FFmpeg2 can help standardise audio formats and sample rates.
• Data Augmentation: To improve robustness, augment the dataset with variations such as dif-
ferent noise levels, accents, or speeds. Techniques like adding background noise, altering pitch, or
changing the tempo can help the model generalise better to real-world conditions.
• Preprocessing: Convert the audio files into a format suitable for Whisper, typically into mel
spectrograms or another time-frequency representation. This transformation is crucial as Whisper
relies on such representations to learn and transcribe speech effectively.
• Model Configuration: Initialise the Whisper model with pre-trained weights. Configure the
model to accommodate the target language or domain-specific adjustments. This includes setting
appropriate hyperparameters, like learning rate and batch size, tailored to the dataset’s size and
complexity.
• Training: Fine-tune the Whisper model on the prepared dataset using a framework like PyTorch
or TensorFlow. Ensure to monitor the model’s performance on a validation set to avoid overfitting.
Techniques like gradient clipping, learning rate scheduling, and early stopping can help maintain
training stability and efficiency.
• Evaluation and Testing: After training, evaluate the model’s performance on a separate test
set to assess its accuracy and generalisability. Metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) or Character
Error Rate (CER) provide insights into how well the model transcribes audio compared to ground
truth transcriptions.
11.4.4
Case Studies and Applications
1. Medical Transcription: Fine-tuning speech LLMs on medical data has led to significant im-
provements in transcribing doctor-patient interactions. Models like Whisper have been fine-tuned
on medical terminologies, resulting in more accurate and reliable transcriptions.
2. Legal Document Processing: Legal firms have employed fine-tuned audio LLMs to transcribe
court proceedings and legal discussions.
Domain-specific fine-tuning has enhanced the models’
ability to recognise and accurately transcribe legal jargon.
3. Customer Service Automation: Companies are using fine-tuned speech models to automate
customer service interactions. These models are trained on customer support data to understand
and respond to queries more effectively, providing a more seamless user experience.

Open Challenges and Research
Directions
12.1
Scalability Issues
The fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, PaLM1 , and T52 has become a critical
area of research, presenting several significant challenges and opening up new avenues for exploration,
particularly in scaling these processes efficiently. This discussion focuses on the two main aspects: the
challenges in scaling fine-tuning processes and potential research directions for scalable solutions.
12.1.1
Challenges in Scaling Fine-Tuning Processes
1. Computational Resources: Large-scale models such as GPT-3 and PaLM require enormous
computational resources for fine-tuning. For instance, fine-tuning a 175-billion parameter model
like GPT-3 necessitates high-performance GPUs or TPUs capable of handling vast amounts of data
and complex operations. The sheer volume of parameters translates to extensive computational
demands. Even a relatively smaller model, such as BERT-large with 340 million parameters, can
be computationally intensive to fine-tune.
2. Memory Requirements: The memory footprint for fine-tuning LLMs is staggering. Each pa-
rameter in the model requires storage, and during training, additional memory is needed to store
intermediate computations, gradients, and optimiser states. For example, loading a 7 billion pa-
rameter model (e.g., LLaMA 2) in FP32 (4 bytes per parameter) requires approximately 28 GB
of GPU memory, while fine-tuning demands around 112 GB of GPU memory[105]. This memory
demand is beyond the capability of most consumer-grade hardware, making fine-tuning accessible
primarily to well-funded organisations or research institutions.
3. Data Volume: LLMs typically require vast amounts of training data to achieve state-of-the-art
performance during fine-tuning. This data needs to be loaded, preprocessed, and fed into the model
at high speeds to maintain efficient training. Managing large datasets can become a bottleneck,
especially if the data is stored in a distributed fashion across multiple systems or if it needs to be
fetched from remote storage.
4. Throughput and Bottlenecks: High throughput is essential to keep GPUs or TPUs fully
utilised. However, data pipelines can become bottlenecks if not properly optimised. For exam-
ple, shuffling large datasets or loading them into memory quickly enough to keep up with the
training process can be challenging. Techniques like data packing, where multiple small examples
are combined into larger batches, help improve throughput but add complexity to data handling
routines.[106]
5. Efficient Use of Resources: The financial and environmental costs of fine-tuning large models
are significant. Large-scale fine-tuning involves not just the direct cost of computational resources
but also the indirect costs associated with energy consumption and infrastructure maintenance.
1https://ai.google/discover/palm2/
2https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/model_doc/t5
97
Techniques such as mixed-precision training and gradient checkpointing can reduce these costs by
optimising memory and computational efficiency.
The challenges in scaling the fine-tuning processes of LLMs are multifaceted and complex, involving sig-
nificant computational, memory, and data handling constraints. Innovations in PEFT, data throughput
optimisation, and resource-efficient training methods are critical for overcoming these challenges. As
LLMs continue to grow in size and capability, addressing these challenges will be essential for making
advanced AI accessible and practical for a wider range of applications.
12.1.2
Research Directions for Scalable Solutions
Advanced PEFT Techniques and Sparse Fine-Tuning
Recent advancements in PEFT techniques, like LoRA and its variant, Quantised LoRA, are revolu-
tionising the scalability of LLMs. LoRA reduces the computational burden by updating only a low-rank
approximation of the parameters, significantly lowering memory and processing requirements. Quantised
LoRA further optimises resource usage by applying quantisation to these low-rank matrices, maintaining
high model performance while minimising the need for extensive hardware. This has enabled efficient
fine-tuning of massive models, such as in Meta’s LLaMA project, where adapting a smaller set of influ-
ential parameters allowed the models to perform robustly across various tasks with less computational
strain.
Sparse fine-tuning techniques, such as SpIEL [107] complement these efforts by selectively updating
only the most impactful parameters. SpIEL fine-tunes models by only changing a small portion of the
parameters, which it tracks with an index. The process includes updating the parameters, removing the
least important ones, and adding new ones based on their gradients or estimated momentum using an
efficient optimiser.
Data Efficient Fine-Tuning (DEFT)
To address the scalability challenges, recently the concept of DEFT has emerged. This novel approach
introduces data pruning as a mechanism to optimise the fine-tuning process by focusing on the most
critical data samples.
DEFT aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of fine-tuning LLMs by selectively pruning the
training data to identify the most influential and representative samples. This method leverages few-shot
learning principles, enabling LLMs to adapt to new data with minimal samples while maintaining or even
exceeding performance levels achieved with full datasets [108].
Key Components of DEFT
High Accuracy Through Influence Score: DEFT introduces the concept of an influence score to
evaluate and rank the importance of each data sample in the context of LLM fine-tuning. The influence
score estimates how removing a specific sample would impact the overall performance of the model. This
approach allows for the selection of a small subset of data that is highly representative and influential,
thereby enabling the model to maintain high accuracy with significantly fewer samples.
High Efficiency Through Effort Score and Surrogate Models: To address the cost and complexity
of evaluating large datasets, DEFT employs a surrogate model—a smaller, computationally less intensive
model—to approximate the influence scores. This surrogate model helps estimate the impact of each
sample without the heavy computational burden associated with directly using the LLM. Additionally,
DEFT introduces an effort score to identify and prioritise more challenging samples that may require
special attention from the LLM. This dual-score system ensures that the fine-tuning process remains
both efficient and effective.
Practical Implications and Use Cases
• Few-Shot Fine-Tuning for Rapid Adaptation: DEFT is particularly beneficial for applica-
tions where models need to quickly adapt to new data with minimal samples. In scenarios such as
98
personalised recommendations or adapting to sudden changes in user behaviour, DEFT allows for
rapid fine-tuning, maintaining high performance with a fraction of the data typically required.
• Reducing Computational Costs in Large-Scale Deployments: By focusing on the most
influential data samples and using surrogate models, DEFT significantly reduces the computational
resources needed for fine-tuning. This makes it feasible to maintain high-performing LLMs even in
large-scale deployments where data volumes are substantial.
Future Directions
The DEFT introduces a data pruning task for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), setting the
stage for new research into efficient LLM-based recommendation systems and presenting numerous op-
portunities for future exploration. Key areas for further investigation include:
• Applying the proposed DEALRec[109] approach to a broader range of LLM-based recommender
models across diverse cross-domain datasets, thereby enhancing fine-tuning performance within
resource constraints.
• Addressing the limited context window of LLMs by selectively focusing on the most informative
items in user interaction sequences for fine-tuning purposes.
12.1.3
Hardware and Algorithm Co-Design
Co-designing hardware and algorithms tailored for LLMs can lead to significant improvements in the
efficiency of fine-tuning processes. Custom hardware accelerators optimised for specific tasks or types of
computation can drastically reduce the energy and time required for model training and fine-tuning.
• Custom Accelerators: Developing hardware accelerators specifically for the sparse and low-
precision computations often used in LLM fine-tuning can enhance performance. These accelerators
are designed to efficiently handle the unique requirements of LLMs, such as the high memory
bandwidth and extensive matrix multiplications involved in transformer architectures.
• Algorithmic Optimisation: Combining hardware innovations with algorithmic optimisation
techniques, such as those that minimise data movement or leverage hardware-specific features
(e.g., tensor cores for mixed-precision calculations), can further enhance the efficiency of fine-tuning
processes.
• Example: NVIDIA’s TensorRT3 is an example of hardware and algorithm co-design in action.
It optimises deep learning models for inference by leveraging NVIDIA GPUs’ capabilities, signifi-
cantly speeding up the process while reducing the resource requirements. TensorRT’s optimisations
include support for mixed-precision and sparse tensor operations, making it highly suitable for fine-
tuning large models.
As the scale of language models continues to grow, addressing the challenges of fine-tuning them efficiently
becomes increasingly critical. Innovations in PEFT, sparse fine-tuning, data handling, and the integration
of advanced hardware and algorithmic solutions present promising directions for future research. These
scalable solutions are essential not only to make the deployment of LLMs feasible for a broader range of
applications but also to push the boundaries of what these models can achieve.
12.2
Ethical Considerations in Fine-Tuning LLMs
12.2.1
Bias and Fairness
When fine-tuning LLMs, the goal is often to optimise their performance for specific tasks or datasets.
However, these datasets may inherently carry biases that get transferred to the model during the fine-
tuning process. Biases can arise from various sources, including historical data, imbalanced training
samples, and cultural prejudices embedded in language. For instance, an LLM fine-tuned on a dataset
primarily sourced from English-speaking countries might underperform or make biased predictions when
3https://docs.nvidia.com/tensorrt/index.html
99
applied to text from other linguistic or cultural backgrounds. Google AI’s Fairness Indicators tool4 is a
practical solution that allows developers to evaluate the fairness of their models by analysing performance
metrics across different demographic groups. This tool can be integrated into the fine-tuning pipeline to
monitor and address bias in real-time.
Addressing Bias and Fairness
• Diverse and Representative Data: Ensuring that fine-tuning datasets are diverse and repre-
sentative of all user demographics can help mitigate bias.
• Fairness Constraints: Incorporating fairness constraints, as suggested by the FairBERTa frame-
work5, ensures that fine-tuned models maintain equitable performance across different groups.
• Example Application: In healthcare, an LLM fine-tuned to assist in diagnosing conditions might
initially be trained on data from predominantly white patients. Such a model could produce less
accurate diagnoses for patients from other racial backgrounds. By using fairness-aware fine-tuning
techniques, healthcare providers can develop models that perform more equitably across diverse
patient populations.
12.2.2
Privacy Concerns
Fine-tuning often involves using sensitive or proprietary datasets, which poses significant privacy risks. If
not properly managed, fine-tuned models can inadvertently leak private information from their training
data. This issue is especially critical in domains like healthcare or finance, where data confidentiality is
paramount.
Ensuring Privacy During Fine-Tuning
• Differential Privacy6: Implementing differential privacy techniques during fine-tuning can pre-
vent models from leaking sensitive information.
• Federated Learning7: Utilising federated learning frameworks allows models to be fine-tuned
across decentralised data sources, which enhances privacy by keeping data localised.
• Example Application: In customer service applications, companies might fine-tune LLMs using
customer interaction data. Employing differential privacy ensures that the model learns from these
interactions without memorising and potentially leaking personal information, thus maintaining
customer confidentiality.
12.2.3
Security Risks
• Security Vulnerabilities in Fine-Tuned Models: Fine-tuned LLMs are susceptible to secu-
rity vulnerabilities, particularly from adversarial attacks. These attacks involve inputs designed to
exploit model weaknesses, causing them to produce erroneous or harmful outputs. Such vulnera-
bilities can be more pronounced in fine-tuned models due to their specialised training data, which
may not cover all possible input scenarios.
• Recent Research and Industry Practices: Microsoft’s Adversarial ML Threat Matrix pro-
vides a comprehensive framework for identifying and mitigating adversarial threats during model
development and fine-tuning. This matrix helps developers understand the potential attack vectors
and implement defensive strategies accordingly.
• Enhancing Security in Fine-Tuning:
– Adversarial Training: Exposing models to adversarial examples during fine-tuning can
enhance their robustness against attacks.
– Security Audits: Regularly conducting security audits on fine-tuned models can help iden-
tify and address potential vulnerabilities.

12.3
Accountability and Transparency
12.3.1
The Need for Accountability and Transparency
Fine-tuning can significantly alter an LLM’s behaviour, making it crucial to document and understand
the changes and their impacts.
This transparency is essential for stakeholders to trust the model’s
outputs and for developers to be accountable for its performance and ethical implications.
12.3.2
Recent Research and Industry Practices
Meta’s Responsible AI framework8 underscores the importance of documenting the fine-tuning process
and its effects on model behaviour. This includes maintaining detailed records of the data used, the
changes made during fine-tuning, and the evaluation metrics applied.
12.3.3
Promoting Accountability and Transparency
• Comprehensive Documentation: Creating detailed documentation of the fine-tuning process
and its impact on model performance and behaviour.
• Transparent Reporting: Utilising frameworks like Model Cards9 to report on the ethical and
operational characteristics of fine-tuned models.
• Example Application: In content moderation systems, LLMs fine-tuned to identify and filter
harmful content need clear documentation and reporting. This ensures that platform users and
regulators understand how the model operates and can trust its moderation decisions.
12.3.4
Proposed frameworks/techniques for Ethical Fine-Tuning
Frameworks for Mitigating Bias
Bias-aware fine-tuning frameworks aim to incorporate fairness into the model training process. Fair-
BERTa, introduced by Facebook, is an example of such a framework that integrates fairness constraints
directly into the model’s objective function during fine-tuning. This approach ensures that the model’s
performance is balanced across different demographic groups.
Organisations can adopt fairness-aware frameworks to develop more equitable AI systems. For instance,
social media platforms can use these frameworks to fine-tune models that detect and mitigate hate speech
while ensuring fair treatment across various user demographics.
Techniques for Privacy Preservation
Differential privacy and federated learning are key techniques for preserving privacy during fine-tuning.
TensorFlow Privacy10, developed by Google, provides built-in support for differential privacy, allowing
developers to fine-tune models securely without compromising data confidentiality.
LLMs are highly effective but face challenges when applied in sensitive areas where data privacy is cru-
cial. To address this, researchers focus on enhancing Small Language Models (SLMs) tailored to specific
domains. Existing methods often use LLMs to generate additional data or transfer knowledge to SLMs,
but these approaches struggle due to differences between LLM-generated data and private client data. In
response, a new Federated Domain-specific Knowledge Transfer (FDKT)[110] framework is introduced.
FDKT leverages LLMs to create synthetic samples that mimic clients’ private data distribution using
differential privacy. This approach significantly boosts SLMs’ performance by approximately 5% while
maintaining data privacy with a minimal privacy budget, outperforming traditional methods relying
solely on local private data.
In healthcare, federated fine-tuning can allow hospitals to collaboratively train models on patient data
without transferring sensitive information. This approach ensures data privacy while enabling the de-
velopment of robust, generalisable AI systems.

101
Frameworks for Enhancing Security
Adversarial training and robust security measures[111] are essential for protecting fine-tuned models
against attacks. The adversarial training approach involves training models with adversarial examples
to improve their resilience against malicious inputs. Microsoft Azure’s adversarial training tools provide
practical solutions for integrating these techniques into the fine-tuning process, helping developers create
more secure and reliable models.
In cybersecurity, fine-tuned LLMs used for threat detection can benefit from adversarial training to
enhance their ability to identify and respond to sophisticated attacks, thereby improving organisational
security.
Frameworks for Ensuring Transparency
Transparency and accountability frameworks, such as Model Cards and AI FactSheets11, provide struc-
tured ways to document and report on the fine-tuning process and the resulting model behaviours. These
frameworks promote understanding and trust among stakeholders by clearly outlining the model’s capa-
bilities, limitations, and ethical considerations.
In government applications, where AI systems might be used for decision-making or public services,
maintaining transparent documentation through frameworks like AI FactSheets ensures that these sys-
tems are accountable and their decisions can be audited and trusted by the public.
Fine-tuning LLMs introduces several ethical challenges, including bias, privacy risks, security vulnera-
bilities, and accountability concerns. Addressing these requires a multifaceted approach that integrates
fairness-aware frameworks, privacy-preserving techniques, robust security measures, and transparency
and accountability mechanisms.
By leveraging recent advancements in these areas, researchers and
practitioners can develop and deploy LLMs that are not only powerful but also ethically sound and
trustworthy.
12.4

presents numerous opportunities and challenges, reflecting advancements and insights from recent re-
search and industry developments.
12.4.1

• Enhanced Decision-Making and Automation: LLMs have the capability to analyse and derive
insights from vast amounts of unstructured data generated by IoT devices. This data can range
from sensor readings in manufacturing plants to environmental data in smart cities. By processing
this data in real-time, LLMs can optimise decision-making processes and automate tasks that
traditionally required human intervention. For example:
– Industrial Applications: Predictive maintenance can be enhanced by LLMs analysing sen-
sor data to predict equipment failures before they occur, thereby reducing downtime and
maintenance costs.
– Smart Cities: LLMs can analyse traffic patterns and environmental data from IoT sensors
to optimise city infrastructure and improve urban planning decisions.

data locally on devices rather than relying solely on cloud-based servers. This enables LLMs to
deliver highly personalised services based on real-time data and user preferences, enhancing user
experiences across various domains:
– Healthcare: LLMs can provide personalised healthcare recommendations by analysing data
from wearable devices and integrating it with medical records securely stored on edge devices.

understand context and respond more intelligently to natural language queries. This can signifi-
cantly improve user interactions with smart environments:
– Smart Homes: LLMs integrated with IoT devices can understand and respond to voice
commands more accurately, adjusting smart home settings based on real-time sensor data
(e.g., adjusting lighting and temperature based on occupancy and environmental conditions).
12.4.2
Challenges
• Data Complexity and Integration: Integrating data from diverse IoT devices poses challenges
related to data quality, interoperability, and scalability.
LLMs need to effectively process and
interpret this heterogeneous data to derive meaningful insights:
– Data Integration: Ensuring seamless integration of data streams from different IoT plat-
forms and devices without compromising data integrity or performance.
– Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preprocessing IoT data to ensure consistency and reli-
ability before feeding it into LLMs for analysis.
• Privacy and Security: Edge computing involves processing sensitive data locally on devices,
raising concerns about data privacy and security:

and LLMs to prevent data breaches or unauthorised access.
• Real-Time Processing and Reliability: LLMs deployed in edge computing environments must
operate with low latency and high reliability to support real-time applications:
– Latency: Optimising algorithms and processing capabilities of LLMs to handle real-time
data streams efficiently without delays.
– Reliability: Ensuring the accuracy and consistency of insights generated by LLMs in dynamic
and unpredictable IoT environments.
12.5
Future Research Areas

LLMs can be trained collaboratively across edge devices without centralised data aggregation.
This approach addresses privacy concerns and reduces communication overhead.
• Real-Time Decision Support Systems: Developing LLM-based systems capable of real-time
decision-making by integrating with edge computing infrastructure. This includes optimising algo-
rithms for low-latency processing and ensuring reliability under dynamic environmental conditions.
• Ethical and Regulatory Implications: Investigating the ethical implications of integrating
LLMs with IoT and edge computing, particularly regarding data ownership, transparency, and
fairness. This area requires frameworks for ethical AI deployment and governance.
