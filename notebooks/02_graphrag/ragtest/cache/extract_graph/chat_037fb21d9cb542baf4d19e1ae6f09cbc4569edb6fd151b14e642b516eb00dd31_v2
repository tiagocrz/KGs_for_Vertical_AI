The LoRA technique is employed for efficient fine-tuning, updating\nonly a small portion of the entire model, as detailed below:\n• Fine-tuning with image captioning: During this stage, the model is fine-tuned using the ROCO\nmedical image-caption dataset, which contains medical image-caption pairs of varying lengths. The\nprompt template used is <Img><ImageHere></Img>[caption] <instruction>, with the instruc-\ntion prompt randomly selected from a pool of four candidates, such as “Briefly describe this image.”\nDuring training, only the linear projection layer and the LoRA layer in the LLM are fine-tuned,\nwhile other parts of the model remain frozen.\n• Fine-tuning on VQA: In the second stage, the model is fine-tuned on the Med-VQA dataset,\nVQA-RAD, which contains triplets of images, questions, and answers. Following the instruction\ntemplate proposed in MiniGPT-v2, the template used is: “[INST] <img><ImageFeature></img>[VQA]\nInstruction [/INST]”, where the instruction prompt is: “Based on the image, respond to this\nquestion with a short answer: question,” with question signifying the question corresponding to\nthe given medical image. The motivation for generating short answers is to validate against the\nexisting labelled data in VQA-RAD, where the answers are typically short in both open-ended and\nclosed-ended QA pairs. Similar to the first stage, the vision encoder and the LLM remain frozen\nwhile only the linear projection and LoRA layers in the LLM are updated.\n11.3\nApplications of Multimodal models\n1. Gesture Recognition - These models interpret and recognise human gestures, which is crucial\nfor sign language translation. Multimodal models facilitate inclusive communication by processing\ngestures and converting them into text or speech.\n2. Video Summarisation - Multimodal models can summarise lengthy videos by extracting key vi-\nsual and audio elements. This capability streamlines content consumption, enables efficient content\nbrowsing, and enhances video content management platforms.\n3. DALL-E is a notable example of multimodal AI that generates images from textual descriptions.\nThis technology expands creative possibilities in content creation and visual storytelling, with\napplications in art, design, advertising, and more.\n4. Educational Tools - Multimodal models enhance learning experiences by providing interactive\neducational content that responds to both visual and verbal cues from students. They are integral\nto adaptive learning platforms that adjust content and difficulty based on student performance and\nfeedback.\n5. Virtual Assistants - Multimodal models power virtual assistants by understanding and respond-\ning to voice commands while processing visual data for comprehensive user interaction. They are\nessential for smart home automation, voice-controlled devices, and digital personal assistants.\n11.4\nAudio or Speech LLMs Or Large Audio Models\nAudio or speech LLMs are models designed to understand and generate human language based on audio\ninputs. They have applications in speech recognition, text-to-speech conversion, and natural language\nunderstanding tasks. These models are typically pre-trained on large datasets to learn generic language\npatterns, which are then fine-tuned on specific tasks or domains to enhance performance.\nAudio and Speech Large Language Models (LLMs) represent a significant advancement in the integration\nof language processing with audio signals. These models leverage a robust Large Language Model as a\nfoundational backbone, which is enhanced to handle multimodal data through the inclusion of custom\naudio tokens. This transformation allows the models to learn and operate within a shared multimodal\nspace, where both text and audio signals can be effectively processed.\n93\nUnlike text, which is inherently discrete, audio signals are continuous and need to be discretized into\nmanageable audio tokens. Techniques like HuBERT[99] and wav2vec[100] are employed for this purpose,\nconverting audio into a tokenized format that the LLM can process alongside text. The model, typically\nautoregressive and decoder-based, is pre-trained using a combination of self-supervised tasks, such as\npredicting masked tokens in interleaved text and audio, and supervised fine-tuning for specific tasks like\ntranscription or sentiment analysis. This capability to handle and generate audio and text simultane-\nously allows for a wide range of applications, from audio question answering to speech-based sentiment\ndetection, making Audio and Speech LLMs a versatile tool in multimodal AI. The figure 11.4 illustrates\nan example of a multimodal Audio LM architecture. In this setup, a prompt provides instructions in\nboth text and audio formats. The audio is tokenized using an audio tokenizer. The multimodal model\nthen combines these text and audio tokens and generates spoken speech through a vocoder (also known\nas a voice decoder).\nFigure 11.4: Multimodal Audio-Text Language Model architecture that integrates text and audio in-\nputs for advanced multimodal processing.\nThe architecture utilises text tokenizers and audio en-\ncoders/tokenizers to convert inputs into tokens, which are then processed by the audio-text LM. This\nmodel supports both discrete and continuous speech processing and enables tasks such as sentiment anal-\nysis and response generation in natural language. The audio tokens are further refined using a vocoder,\nwhile text tokens are detokenized to produce coherent text outputs (adapted from [101]).\n94\nAudio and speech LLMs like AudioPaLM[102], AudioLM[103], and various adaptations of models like\nWhisper and LLaMA, integrate capabilities for understanding and generating audio data, including\nspeech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama3.2:3b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_037fb21d9cb542baf4d19e1ae6f09cbc4569edb6fd151b14e642b516eb00dd31_v2"}
