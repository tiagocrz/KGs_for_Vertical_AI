This technological effort is\naimed at creating a robust, intuitive, and highly effective solution that meets the specific\nneeds of users.\nThe nature of the project - focused on the development of a digital solution with the potential\nto transform the sector - aligns with the company's growth objectives. The creation of the AI\nAgent will allow Granter.ai to consolidate its position in the public funding application sector\nand diversify its service offering, increasing its responsiveness to new markets and\ngenerating new revenue streams through a scalable licensing model. It is expected to be\navailable in different languages and adapted to the legal and operational frameworks of other\ncountries, which reinforces its replicability and the solution's internationalization potential.\nThe choice of the \"Support for Startup or Growth\" typology is even more relevant considering\nthat this product will be the strategic engine for the company's future growth. It is a central\nelement in Granter.ai's medium- and long-term vision, and it is also essential for fulfilling the\ncompany's mission, which is to democratize and facilitate access to public funding\nopportunities. This project is not just another tool - it is the catalyst for a new phase of\nexpansion, enabling the leveraging of already developed competencies and opening the door\nfor new applications and partnerships.\nTherefore, the \"Support for Startup or Growth\" typology is considered the best fit to reflect\nthe nature, objectives, and ambition of this project, being the necessary lever to consolidate\nGranter.ai's competitive position and accelerate its sustainable and innovative growth\ntrajectory.\n\n\fRelevance of the Project to the Measure’s Objectives by Presenting an\nInnovative Business Model, Product, or Service with String Digital or\nTechnological Components and Scalability Potential\n(limit 5000)\n\nGranter.ai presents a project that fully meets the objectives of the measure by developing a\ndigital product with a strong technological component and high scalability potential. This is\nthe first AI Agent specifically designed to support businesses in identifying, planning,\nmonitoring, and submitting public funding applications. This solution represents a significant\nadvance in terms of innovation and digital transformation in the sector, characterized as a\nhighly specialized, technologically sophisticated, and unique product in the market.\nThe project proposes the creation of proprietary software, developed entirely with internal\nresources, which combines several AI-based functionalities, with an emphasis on the\nautomatic and personalized generation of applications. The design of this project was\nconceived to integrate the latest trends in artificial intelligence, adapting them to the concrete\npractice of public funding. The tool combines methodologies such as Generative Adversarial\nNetworks (GANs) and Adversarial In-Context Learning (Adv-ICL), allowing the generation of\noptimized content aligned with the specific criteria of each funding notice. This approach\nensures not only innovation in the final product but also in the development methodology,\nwith a clear emphasis on R&D and technological knowledge transfer to the market.\nThe functionalities of the AI Agent cover all stages of the application process: from identifying\nopportunities, analyzing eligibility, and drafting the application, to evaluating, automating\nsubmission, and managing projects after approval. This comprehensive approach provides\nthe tool with added value, with a direct impact on the efficiency and effectiveness of the\naccess to funding process.\nThe project's relevance is also evident in its ability to address a real and growing need in the\nbusiness ecosystem: effective access to public funding mechanisms. Through the automation\nand simplification of highly complex processes, Granter.ai's AI Agent will increase the\nproductivity of specialists and businesses, reduce errors and inefficiencies, and improve the\nsuccess rate of applications. At the same time, it introduces a strategic support logic, helping\nusers better align their projects with the objectives and priorities of the European Union,\nwhich will increase the structural quality of the submitted proposals.\nThis new product will be designed to respond to a variety of contexts and user profiles,\nincorporating a modular and scalable architecture that allows the solution to be easily\nadapted to different markets and languages. The very development logic aims at international\nreplicability, with identified markets such as Spain, Italy, and the USA for Granter.ai's initial\nexpansion. Scalability is also ensured by the proposed business model, based on an annual\nsubscription strategy somewhat similar to that used in SaaS (Software as a Service) business\nmodels, with different access levels depending on each individual or business needs.\n\n\fGranter.ai's proposal also has a strategic dimension within the context of the digital transition\npromoted by the PRR. By providing businesses with a tool that combines artificial\nintelligence, automation, and usability, the project directly contributes to the \"Companies\n4.0\" measure's objectives, promoting business model modernization, technological\nempowerment of the business fabric, and the spread of intelligent digital solutions.\nAdditionally, it is expected that there will be a positive, albeit indirect, impact on promoting\neco-innovation and digital transformation: by facilitating access to funding in programs\nrelated to sustainability, efficiency, and the green economy, Granter.ai can enhance more\nsustainable business practices, promote eco-efficiency, and encourage the emergence of new\ntechnology-based business models.\nThe project's relevance is further reinforced by the strategic vision behind it. The AI Agent\nrepresents a new growth axis for the company, but also a differentiated value proposition for\nthe market, with the capacity to redefine efficiency and quality standards in public funding\nconsultancy. This project positions Granter.ai as a technology-driven, innovative company\ncapable of leading a paradigm shift, both in Portugal and across the European Union.\nThe presented project fully meets\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_12ea98518e19b95c73c17545b32fa277603492c0b1d2464570c9f8d9572fe9ef_v2"}
