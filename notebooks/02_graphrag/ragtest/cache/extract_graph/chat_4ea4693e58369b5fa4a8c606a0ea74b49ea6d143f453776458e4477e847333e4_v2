Therefore, businesses leveraging Amazon\nBedrock will also need to use these complementary AWS services to fully realise its potential. This\ninterconnectedness means that while Amazon Bedrock enhances the AI capabilities within an AWS\necosystem, it may present a steep learning curve and require significant infrastructure management for\nthose new to AWS.\n10.5.3\nTutorials\n1. Finetuning LLMs on Amazon Bedrock\n2. Amazon Bedrock for Generative AI\n10.6\nOpenAI’s Fine-Tuning API\nOpenAI’s Fine-Tuning API is a comprehensive platform that facilitates the customisation of OpenAI’s\npre-trained LLMs to cater to specific tasks and domains. This service is designed to be user-friendly,\nenabling a broad range of users, from businesses to individual developers, to harness the power of\nadvanced AI without the complexities typically associated with model training and deployment.\n10.6.1\nSteps Involved in Using OpenAI’s Fine-Tuning API\n• Model Selection:\n– Choosing a Pre-Trained Model: Users begin by selecting a base model from OpenAI’s\nextensive lineup. This includes powerful models like GPT-4, which offer a robust starting\npoint for a wide range of language processing tasks.\n– Customisable Base: These models come pre-trained with vast amounts of data, providing\na solid foundation that can be further refined to suit specific requirements.\n• Data Preparation and Upload:\n85\n– Curating Relevant Data: Users need to gather and prepare a dataset that reflects the\nspecific task or domain they wish to fine-tune the model for. This data is crucial for teaching\nthe model to perform the desired function more effectively.\n– Uploading Data to the API: The Fine-Tuning API facilitates easy data upload. Users\ncan feed their curated datasets into the API through straightforward commands, making the\nprocess accessible even to those with limited technical backgrounds.\n• Initiating Fine-Tuning:\n– Automated Process: Once the data is uploaded, OpenAI’s infrastructure handles the fine-\ntuning process. The API adjusts the model’s parameters based on the new data to improve\nperformance on the specified tasks.\n• Deploying the Fine-Tuned Model:\n– API Integration: The fine-tuned model can be accessed and deployed via OpenAI’s API.\nThis allows for seamless integration into various applications, such as chatbots, automated\ncontent creation tools, or specialised customer service systems.\n10.6.2\nLimitations of OpenAI’s Fine-Tuning API\n• Pricing Models: Fine-tuning and using OpenAI’s models through the API can be costly, espe-\ncially for large-scale deployments or continuous usage. This can be a significant consideration for\nsmaller organisations or budget-constrained projects.\n• Data Privacy and Security: Users must upload their data to OpenAI’s servers for the fine-\ntuning process. This raises potential concerns about data privacy and the security of sensitive or\nproprietary information.\n• Dependency on OpenAI Infrastructure: The reliance on OpenAI’s infrastructure for model\nhosting and API access can lead to vendor lock-in, limiting flexibility and control over the deploy-\nment environment.\n• Limited Control Over Training Process: The fine-tuning process is largely automated and\nmanaged by OpenAI, offering limited visibility and control over the specific adjustments made to\nthe model.\n10.6.3\nTutorials\n1. Fine-Tuning GPT-3 Using the OpenAI API\n10.7\nNVIDIA NeMo Customizer\nNVIDIA NeMo Customiser8 is part of the NeMo framework, a suite of tools and models designed by\nNVIDIA to facilitate the development and fine-tuning of LLM models. The Customiser focuses specifi-\ncally on making it easier to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) for specialised tasks and domains.\nLike other fine-tuning tools, NeMo Customiser is geared toward users who want to adapt pre-trained\nmodels for specific applications, such as conversational AI, translation, or domain-specific text gener-\nation. It delivers enterprise-ready models by offering accurate data curation, extensive customisation\noptions, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and improved performance features. The platform sup-\nports training and deploying generative AI models across diverse environments, including cloud, data\ncenter, and edge locations.
