This method enables the model to generalise across various tasks without requiring\ntask-specific fine-tuning (adopted from [90]).\n11.2\nFine-tuning of multimodal models\nFor fine-tuning a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM), PEFT techniques such as LoRA and\nQLoRA can be utilised. The process of fine-tuning for multimodal applications is analogous to that for\nlarge language models, with the primary difference being the nature of the input data. In addition to\nLoRA, which employs matrix factorisation techniques to reduce the number of parameters, other tools\nsuch as LLM-Adapters and (IA)³[91] can be effectively used. LLM-Adapters integrate various adapter\nmodules into the pre-trained model’s architecture, enabling parameter-efficient fine-tuning for diverse\ntasks by updating only the adapter parameters while keeping the base model parameters fixed. (IA)³,\nor Infused Adapters by Inhibiting and Amplifying Inner Activations, enhances performance by learn-\ning vectors to weight model parameters through activation multiplications, supporting robust few-shot\nperformance and task mixing without manual adjustments. Moreover, dynamic adaptation techniques\nlike DyLoRA[92] allow for the training of low-rank adaptation blocks across different ranks, optimising\nthe learning process by sorting the representations during training. LoRA-FA[93], a variant of LoRA,\noptimises the fine-tuning process by freezing the first low-rank matrix after initialisation and using it as a\nrandom projection while training the other, thereby reducing the number of parameters by half without\ncompromising performance.\nThe Efficient Attention Skipping (EAS)[94] module introduces a novel parameter and computation-\nefficient tuning method for MLLMs, aiming to maintain high performance while reducing parameter and\ncomputation costs for downstream tasks. However, MemVP[95] critiques this approach, noting that it\nstill increases the input length of language models. To address this, MemVP integrates visual prompts\nwith the weights of Feed Forward Networks, thereby injecting visual knowledge to decrease training time\nand inference latency, ultimately outperforming previous PEFT methods.\n11.2.1\nFull-parameter Fine-Tuning\nMethods such as those introduced by LOMO[96] and MeZO[97] provide alternative solutions by focusing\non memory efficiency.\nLOMO utilises a low-memory optimisation technique derived from Stochastic\nGradient Descent (SGD), reducing memory consumption typically associated with the ADAM optimiser.\nMeZO, on the other hand, offers a memory-efficient optimiser that requires only two forward passes\nto compute gradients, enabling comprehensive fine-tuning of large models with a memory footprint\nequivalent to inference [89].\n91\n11.2.2\nCase study of fine-tuning MLLMs for Medical domain\nThe following section provides a case study on fine-tuning MLLMs for the Visual Question Answering\n(VQA) task. In this example, we present a PEFT for fine-tuning MLLM specifically designed for Med-\nVQA applications. To ensure accurate performance measurement, human evaluations were conducted,\ndemonstrating that the model achieves an overall accuracy of 81.9% and surpasses the GPT-4v model\nby a substantial margin of 26% in absolute accuracy on closed-ended questions.\nThe model consists of three components: the vision encoder, a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM)\nfor handling multimodal inputs and generating responses, and a single linear layer for projecting embed-\ndings from the visual encoding space to the LLM space, as shown in figure 11.3.\nThe Vision Transformer (ViT) type backbone, EVA, encodes image tokens into visual embeddings,\nwith model weights remaining frozen during the fine-tuning process. The technique from MiniGPT-v2\nis utilised, grouping four consecutive tokens into one visual embedding to efficiently reduce resource\nconsumption by concatenating on the embedding dimension.\nThese grouped visual tokens are then processed through the projection layer, resulting in embeddings\n(length 4096) in the LLM space. A multimodal prompt template integrates both visual and question\ninformation, which is input into the pre-trained LLM, LLaMA2-chat(7B), for answer generation. The\nlow-rank adaptation (LoRA) technique is applied for efficient fine-tuning, keeping the rest of the LLM\nfrozen during downstream fine-tuning. A beam search with a width of 1 is utilised.\nFigure 11.3: Overview of Med VQA architecture integrating LoRA and a pre-trained LLM with a Vision\nEncoder for medical visual question answering tasks. The architecture includes stages for processing\nimages and generating contextually relevant responses, demonstrating the integration of vision and lan-\nguage models in a medical setting (adopted from [98]).\nThe multimodal prompt includes input images, questions, and a specific token for VQA tasks, following\nthe MiniGPT-v2 template. In Figure 11.3, the image features derived from linear projection are labelled\nas ImageFeature, with the corresponding questions serving as text instructions. The special token [VQA]\nis used as the task identifier, forming the complete multimodal instructional template:\n92\n[INST]<img><ImageFeature></img>[VQA] Instruction [/INST].\nModel Training\nWeights from MiniGPT-v2, pre-trained on general domain datasets, are further fine-tuned using multi-\nmodal medical datasets in two stages. The LoRA technique is employed for efficient fine-tuning, updating\nonly a small portion of the entire model, as detailed below:\n• Fine-tuning with image captioning: During this stage, the model is fine-tuned using the ROCO\nmedical image-caption dataset, which contains medical image\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama3.2:3b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_92726db8a218db1d7277030fcc05572f0e5e218eccfca9861be6ecb24f3b1e4a_v2"}
