This\nmethod is highly efficient.\n2. Linear Combination: Although less documented, this method appears to perform a weighted\nsum of the adapters’ parameters.\n3. SVD: The default method employs singular value decomposition through torch.linalg.svd. While\nversatile, it is notably slower than the other methods, particularly for adapters with high ranks\n(greater than 100), which can take several hours.\nEach method allows for customising the combination by adjusting weights. For instance, when merging\ntwo adapters, X and Y, assigning more weight to X ensures that the resulting adapter prioritises behaviour\nsimilar to X over Y.\nThis approach is particularly suited for consolidating a single LLM to handle multiple tasks rather than\ncreating separate models for each task domain. By adopting this method, there is no longer a need to\n3https://huggingface.co/docs/peft/main/en/package_reference/lora#peft.LoraModel.add_weighted_adapter\n43\nindividually fine-tune a model for each task. Instead, a single adapter layer can be fine-tuned for each\ntask, allowing queries to yield the desired responses efficiently.\nFigure 6.6: Overview of how multiple adapters can be used with a pre-trained LLM to fine-tune it for\nvarious specific tasks, such as summarisation, proofreading, sentiment analysis, and more. (adapted from\n[67])\nSteps for Fine-Tuning LLM with LoRA for Multiple Tasks and Adapters\n1. Adapter Creation: Create multiple adapters, each fine-tuned for specific tasks using different\nprompt formats or task-identifying tags (e.g., [translate fren], [chat]).\n2. LoRA Integration: Implement LoRA to efficiently integrate these adapters into the pre-trained\nLLM. Utilise LoRA’s methods such as concatenation, linear combination, or singular value decom-\nposition (SVD) to combine adapters while minimising computational overhead and maintaining\nperformance.\n3. Task-Specific Adaptation: Fine-tune each adapter with task-specific data to enhance perfor-\nmance for individual tasks. Ensure adapters are trained with data relevant to their respective\ntasks, optimising their ability to generate accurate responses.\n4. Behaviour Adjustment: Monitor the behaviour of combined adapters to identify any undesired\ninherited behaviours from individual adapters (e.g., short response generation from a translation\n44\nadapter). Adjust the combination weights or types to modify adapter behaviour as needed, ensuring\neach adapter performs optimally for its intended task.\n5. Evaluation and Iteration: Evaluate the performance of the combined model across multiple\ntasks using validation datasets. Iterate on the fine-tuning process, making adjustments to adapter\ncombinations and training parameters based on performance metrics and user feedback.\nTherefore, for optimal performance, it is advisable to combine adapters that have been fine-tuned with\ndistinctly varied prompt formats. However, even when using adapters with different prompt formats, the\nresulting adapter may not exhibit desired behaviour. For example, a newly combined adapter designed for\nchatting may only generate short responses, inheriting this tendency from an adapter that was originally\ntrained to halt after producing a single sentence. To adjust the behaviour of the combined adapter,\none can prioritise the influence of a specific adapter during the combination process and/or modify the\nmethod of combination used.\nAn illustrative tutorial demonstrating the fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) using multiple\nadapter layers for various tasks can be found here.\n6.4\nHalf Fine Tuning\nHalf Fine-Tuning (HFT)[68] is a technique designed to balance the retention of foundational knowledge\nwith the acquisition of new skills in large language models (LLMs). HFT involves freezing half of the\nmodel’s parameters during each fine-tuning round while updating the other half, allowing the model to\nretain pre-trained knowledge and enhance new task performance without altering the model architecture.\nEach repetitive transformer layer is divided into three blocks: self-attention, feed-forward, and layernorm,\nwith half of the parameters in each block updated and the other half frozen, varying with each round.\nThis strategic parameter update helps maintain knowledge parity across training rounds and enhances\nscalability in successive training sessions.\nResearch on models like LLAMA 2-7B demonstrated that HFT could significantly restore forgotten basic\nknowledge while preserving high general ability performance. This method’s robustness and efficiency\nmake it applicable to various fine-tuning scenarios, including supervised fine-tuning, direct preference\noptimisation, and continual learning. Additionally, HFT’s ability to maintain the model architecture\nsimplifies its implementation and ensures compatibility with existing systems, further promoting its\npractical adoption.\n6.4.1\nBenefits of using Half Fine tuning\n1. Recovery of Pre-Trained Knowledge: By rolling back half of the fine-tuned parameters to their\npre-trained state, HFT effectively recovers a portion of the original knowledge, thereby mitigating\ncatastrophic forgetting of previously acquired capabilities.\n2. Enhanced Performance: Research experiments shows that HFT maintains or even surpasses\nthe performance of full fine-tuning (FFT) on downstream tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness in\nbalancing knowledge retention with task-specific learning.\n3. Robustness: The method is robust to different selection strategies and the number of parameters\nchosen for updating, ensuring consistent performance across various configurations.\n4. Simplicity and Scalability: HFT does not alter the model architecture, which simplifies im-\nplementation and allows for scalable applications, particularly beneficial in successive fine-tuning\nscenarios.\n5. Versatility: The technique has proven effective across diverse fine-tuning scenarios, including\nsupervised fine-tuning, direct preference optimisation, and continual learning.\n45\nFigure 6.7: Schematic illustration of the Half Fine-T\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama3.2:3b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_9bc76b6b474d0c482e244dd3828f424d05a299010cd2a922d103405cb2a30e9b_v2"}
