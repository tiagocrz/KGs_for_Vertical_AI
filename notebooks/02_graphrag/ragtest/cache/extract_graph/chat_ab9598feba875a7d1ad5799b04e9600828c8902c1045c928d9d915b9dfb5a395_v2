RAG systems provide an advantage with dynamic data retrieval capabilities for environments\nwhere data frequently updates or changes. Additionally, it is crucial to ensure the transparency and\ninterpret ability of the model’s decision-making process. In that case, RAG systems offer insight that is\ntypically not available in models that are solely fine-tuned.

The\nreport examines various fine-tuning methodologies, their applications, and recent advancements.\n1.10.2\nKey Questions and Issues Addressed\nThis report addresses critical questions surrounding fine-tuning LLMs, starting with foundational in-\nsights into LLMs, their evolution, and significance in NLP. It defines fine-tuning, distinguishes it from\npre-training, and emphasises its role in adapting models for specific tasks. Key objectives include en-\nhancing model performance for targeted applications and domains.\nThe report outlines a structured fine-tuning process, featuring a high-level pipeline with visual rep-\nresentations and detailed stage explanations. It covers practical implementation strategies, including\nmodel initialisation, hyperparameter definition, and fine-tuning techniques such as Parameter-Efficient\nFine-Tuning (PEFT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Industry applications, evaluation\nmethods, deployment challenges, and recent advancements are also explored.\n1.10.3\nOverview of the Report Structure\nThe rest of the report provides a comprehensive understanding of fine-tuning LLMs. The main chapters\ninclude an in-depth look at the fine-tuning pipeline, practical applications, model alignment, evaluation\nmetrics, and challenges. The concluding sections discuss the evolution of fine-tuning techniques, highlight\nongoing research challenges, and provide insights for researchers and practitioners.\n13\nChapter 2\nSeven Stage Fine-Tuning Pipeline\nfor LLM\nFine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) is a comprehensive process divided into seven distinct\nstages, each essential for adapting the pre-trained model to specific tasks and ensuring optimal per-\nformance. These stages encompass everything from initial dataset preparation to the final deployment\nand maintenance of the fine-tuned model. By following these stages systematically, the model is refined\nand tailored to meet precise requirements, ultimately enhancing its ability to generate accurate and\ncontextually appropriate responses. The seven stages include Dataset Preparation, Model Initialisation,\nTraining Environment Setup, Fine-Tuning, Evaluation and Validation, Deployment, and Monitoring and\nMaintenance.\nFigure 2.1 illustrates the comprehensive pipeline for fine-tuning LLMs, encompassing all necessary stages\nfrom dataset preparation to monitoring and maintenance.\n2.1\nStage 1: Dataset Preparation\nFine-tuning a Large Language Model (LLM) starts with adapting the pre-trained model for specific tasks\nby updating its parameters using a new dataset. This involves cleaning and formatting the dataset to\nmatch the target task, such as instruction tuning, sentiment analysis, or topic mapping. The dataset is\ncomposed of < input, output > pairs, demonstrating the desired behaviour for the model.\nFor example, in instruction tuning, the dataset may look like:\n###Human: $<Input Query>$\n###Assistant: $<Generated Output>$\nHere, the ’Input Query’ is what the user asks, and the ’Generated Output’ is the model’s response. The\nstructure and style of these pairs can be adjusted based on the specific needs of the task.\n2.2\nStage 2: Model Initialisation\nModel initialisation is the process of setting up the initial parameters and configurations of the LLM\nbefore training or deploying it. This step is crucial for ensuring the model performs optimally, trains\nefficiently, and avoids issues such as vanishing or exploding gradients.\n2.3\nStage 3: Training Environment Setup\nSetting up the training environment for LLM fine-tuning involves configuring the necessary infrastructure\nto adapt a pre-existing model for specific tasks. This includes selecting relevant training data, defining the\nmodel’s architecture and hyperparameters, and running training iterations to adjust the model’s weights\nand biases.\nThe aim is to enhance the LLM’s performance in generating accurate and contextually\nappropriate outputs tailored to specific applications, like content creation, translation, or sentiment\nanalysis. Successful fine-tuning relies on careful preparation and rigorous experimentation.\n14\nFigure 2.1: A comprehensive pipeline for fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs), illustrating the\nseven essential stages: Dataset Preparation, Model Initialisation, Training Environment Setup, Fine-\nTuning, Evaluation and Validation, Deployment, and Monitoring and Maintenance. Each stage plays\na crucial role in adapting the pre-trained model to specific tasks and ensuring optimal performance\nthroughout its lifecycle.\n2.4\nStage 4: Partial or Full Fine-Tuning\nThis stage involves updating the parameters of the LLM using a task-specific dataset. Full fine-tuning up-\ndates all parameters of the model, ensuring comprehensive adaptation to the new task. Alternatively, Half\nfine-tuning (HFT) [15] or Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approaches, such as using adapter\nlayers\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama3.2:3b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_ab9598feba875a7d1ad5799b04e9600828c8902c1045c928d9d915b9dfb5a395_v2"}
