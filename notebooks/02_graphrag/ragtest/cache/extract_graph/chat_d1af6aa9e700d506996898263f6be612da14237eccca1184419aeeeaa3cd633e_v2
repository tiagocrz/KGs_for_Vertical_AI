The AI Agent\nrepresents a new growth axis for the company, but also a differentiated value proposition for\nthe market, with the capacity to redefine efficiency and quality standards in public funding\nconsultancy. This project positions Granter.ai as a technology-driven, innovative company\ncapable of leading a paradigm shift, both in Portugal and across the European Union.\nThe presented project fully meets the objectives of the measure by proposing the\ndevelopment of a product with a solid technological foundation and high scalability potential.\nGranter.ai's proposal is a clear example of how digitalization and artificial intelligence can be\nstrategically applied to generate added value and accelerate the growth of tech startups.\n\nImplementation Capacity of the Beneficiaries through a Management\nTeam with Adequate Technological and Management Skills for Business\nModel Development\n(limit 5000)\n\nGranter.ai brings together a highly qualified management team, with technical and\nmanagerial skills fully suitable for the development and implementation of the proposed\nproject. The execution of this project – the development of an AI Agent in the context of public\nfunds – requires a wide range of capabilities in artificial intelligence, software engineering,\nstrategic leadership, product management, and commercial expansion. The founding team of\nGranter.ai ensures the presence of all these skills, with roles clearly distributed and aligned\nwith the project's objectives.\nThe project leadership is under the responsibility of Duarte Gomes, CEO and founder of the\ncompany, who brings a solid experience in business creation and scalability. He was part of\nthe initial Uber Eats team in Portugal and founded three startups, accumulating over eight\nyears of experience in B2B sales and team management. His role in this project focuses on\ndefining the overall strategy, managing operations, and leading the international growth of\nthe solution. His practical experience with clients and positioning complex digital solutions\nin the market ensures the commercial and strategic direction of the project.\n\n\fThe technological aspect is led by Joel Rodrigues, co-founder and CTO of Granter.ai, with more\nthan a decade of experience as Chief Technology Officer in various startups and scale-ups. He\nwas also Head of Incubation at Demium in Portugal and CTO of GoParity, accumulating\nexpertise in team management, system architecture, and digital product development. Within\nthis project, Joel Rodrigues will be responsible for the technical planning and execution of the\nsolution, leading the technological definition, the selection of AI approaches to be adopted\n(including GANs and Adv-ICL), and overseeing the development of the proprietary software.\nComplementing the operational management structure, Luis Batista, Head of Operations,\nplays a key role in improving the technical output obtained through the AI Agent. With four\nyears of experience in management and operational leadership, including working with\nmultinational companies across three continents, Luis Batista will be responsible for the\ntechnical execution of the project, as well as building and validating the different databases\nrequired. His previous experience as an international expansion consultant is an important\nasset for ensuring an efficient and results-oriented implementation.\nOn the technical side, the project also includes Ricardo Moreira, Tech Lead at Granter.ai. With\nfour years of experience in software development, he was previously CTO of an HR Tech\nstartup and worked at Siemens in networking and cybersecurity. Ricardo will be responsible\nfor the practical implementation of the AI Agent's features, the integration of AI models, and\napplying best practices for secure and scalable development. His experience in complex\nbusiness environments adds robustness to the project.\nFinally, the go-to-market and commercialization component will be led by Rodrigo Mendes,\nHead of Sales, with over seven years of experience in sales and strategic marketing. His\nprofessional experience includes companies like Otovo and Too Good To Go, and his role in\nthe project will be to ensure market penetration both nationally and internationally, leading\nuser acquisition strategies and defining licensing packages. His experience in communicating\ntechnological value propositions to different market segments is essential for ensuring the\nproject's commercial success.\nThis team combines technical know-how with a deep understanding of digital markets,\nallowing Granter.ai to internally gather all the necessary skills for the project's execution. The\nteam is agile, multidisciplinary, and highly motivated, with a proven track record of effective\ncollaboration and achieving ambitious goals in short periods. The existence of a core team\nwith proven experience in creating and implementing digital products provides a solid\nfoundation for the execution of the project.\nAdditionally, the project will be strengthened with the hiring of a front-end developer\nspecializing in artificial intelligence, who will be crucial for creating the tool, ensuring it\nremains intuitive. This hire is essential to ensure the project's technical demands are met.\nIn summary, Granter.ai's team is fully aligned with the project's requirements, both at the\nstrategic leadership level and in technical and commercial execution. The complementarity\nbetween the team members, combined with their previous experience and demonstrated\n\n\fexecution capacity, ensures the AI Agent's successful implementation, making a meaningful\ncontribution to the measure's objectives and the company's sustainable growth.\n\nImpact of the Project on the Competitiveness of the Beneficiaries through\nthe Project’s Contribution to Differentiation in the Market\n(limit 5000)\n\nThe project presented by Granter.ai will have a profound impact on its competitiveness,\ngiving it a differentiating position in the market for technological solutions applied to\nconsultancy. By creating an AI Agent dedicated to preparing applications for community\nfunds, the company places itself at the forefront of digital transformation in the sector,\noffering a technologically robust and highly practical solution.\nGranter.ai's differentiation from the competition lies in the unique value proposition of the\nproject: providing an\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4.1-nano", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_d1af6aa9e700d506996898263f6be612da14237eccca1184419aeeeaa3cd633e_v2"}
