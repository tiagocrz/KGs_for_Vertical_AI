This improves generalisation and is suitable for fine-tuning large\nmodels.\nPros:\n• Includes weight decay for better regularisation.\n• Combines Adam’s adaptive learning rate with L2 regularisation.\n• Improves generalisation.\n• Reduces overfitting compared to Adam.\nCons:\n• Slightly more complex than Adam.\n• Requires careful tuning of the weight decay parameter.\n• Slightly slower than Adam due to additional computations.\n• Requires more memory.\nWhen to Use: AdamW is ideal for scenarios where regularisation is needed, such as preventing\noverfitting in large models and fine-tuning pre-trained models.\nA comprehensive collection of optimisation algorithms implemented within the PyTorch library can be\nfound in here. The Hugging Face Transformers package also offers a variety of optimisers for initialising\nand fine-tuning language models, available here.\n31\n5.5\nChallenges in Training Setup\n1. Ensuring compatibility and proper configuration of high-performance hardware like GPUs or TPUs\ncan be complex and time-consuming.\n2. Managing dependencies and versions of deep learning frameworks and libraries to avoid conflicts\nand leverage the latest features.\n3. Selecting an appropriate learning rate is critical, as too high a rate can cause suboptimal conver-\ngence, while too low a rate can make the training process excessively slow.\n4. Determining the optimal batch size that balances memory constraints and training efficiency, es-\npecially given the large memory requirements of LLMs.\n5. Choosing the right number of epochs to avoid underfitting or overfitting the model, requiring careful\nmonitoring and validation.\n6. Selecting the most suitable optimiser for the specific training task to efficiently update the model’s\nweights.\n7. Choosing the correct loss function to accurately measure model performance and guide the opti-\nmisation process.\n5.6\nBest Practices\n• Optimal Learning Rate: Use a lower learning rate, typically between 1e-4 to 2e-4, to ensure\nstable convergence. A learning rate schedule, such as learning rate warm-up followed by a linear\ndecay, can also be beneficial. This helps in initially stabilising the training and then allowing the\nmodel to converge more accurately.\n• Batch Size Considerations: Opt for a batch size that balances memory constraints and training\nefficiency.\nSmaller batch sizes can help in achieving faster convergence but may require more\nfrequent updates. Conversely, larger batch sizes can be more memory-intensive but may lead to\nmore stable updates. Experiment with different batch sizes to find the optimal balance for your\nspecific use case.\n• Save Checkpoints Regularly: Regularly save model weights at various intervals across 5-8\nepochs to capture optimal performance without overfitting. Implement early stopping mechanisms\nto halt training once the model performance starts to degrade on the validation set, thereby pre-\nventing overfitting [51].\n• Hyperparameter Tuning: Utilise hyperparameter tuning methods like grid search, random\nsearch, and Bayesian optimisation to find the optimal set of hyperparameters.\nTools such as\nOptuna, Hyperopt, and Ray Tune can automate this process and help in efficiently exploring the\nhyperparameter space [49].\n• Data Parallelism and Model Parallelism: For large-scale training, consider using data paral-\nlelism or model parallelism techniques to distribute the training workload across multiple GPUs or\nTPUs. Libraries like Horovod and DeepSpeed can facilitate efficient distributed training, helping\nto reduce training time and manage memory usage effectively [52, 53].\n• Regular Monitoring and Logging: Implement robust monitoring and logging to track training\nmetrics, resource usage, and potential bottlenecks. Tools like TensorBoard, Weights & Biases, and\nMLflow can provide real-time insights into the training process, allowing for timely interventions\nand adjustments.\n• Handling Overfitting and Underfitting: Ensure that your model generalises well by imple-\nmenting techniques to handle overfitting and underfitting. regularisation techniques such as L2\nregularisation, dropout, and data augmentation can help prevent overfitting. Conversely, if your\nmodel is underfitting, consider increasing the model complexity or training for more epochs.\n32\n• Use Mixed Precision Training: Mixed precision training involves using both 16-bit and 32-bit\nfloating-point types to reduce memory usage and increase computational efficiency. This technique\ncan significantly speed up training and reduce the required memory footprint, especially when\nusing large models. NVIDIA’s Apex and TensorFlow’s mixed precision API provide support for\nimplementing mixed precision training [54].\n• Evaluate and Iterate: Continuously evaluate the model performance using a separate validation\nset and iterate on the training process based on the results. Regularly update your training data\nand retrain the model to keep it current with new data trends and patterns.\n• Documentation and Reproducibility: Maintain thorough documentation of your training\nsetup, including the hardware configuration, software environment, and hyperparameters used.\nEnsure reproducibility by setting random seeds and providing detailed records of the training\nprocess. This practice not only aids in debugging and further development but also facilitates\ncollaboration and sharing of results with the broader research community.\n33\nChapter 6\nStage\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama3.2:3b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_dd2dc68d7f68e3076bf99ce968239514ce390365aa110134f5c4bec14b9e2a9a_v2"}
