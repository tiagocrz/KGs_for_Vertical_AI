The proposed project involves the creation of an AI agent that\nwill assist businesses in preparing applications for financing programs, integrating research\nand technological development activities. It incorporates advanced methodologies such as\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Adversarial In-Context Learning (Adv-ICL),\nenabling the generation of specialized content adapted to the client's context. This is a\nproprietary software, developed internally, that values the practical application of technical\nand scientific knowledge by transforming theoretical AI models into solutions with direct\nimpact on sector efficiency and innovation. The ability to adapt to multiple markets and the\nstrong emphasis on automating complex processes reinforce its alignment with a high-tech\nsector, with strong growth potential..\n\nProject Summary\n(limit 1000)\n\nGranter.ai is a startup focused on AI solutions applied to public funding. Granter aims to\ndevelop an AI Agent for use by businesses in preparing applications for financing programs.\nThis tool seeks to transform the way these applications are prepared, assisting in identifying\nopportunities, automating submissions, managing associated bureaucracy, and monitoring\nprojects. The solution will integrate AI methodologies tailored to the reality and context of\npublic funds, such as Generative Adversarial Networks and Adversarial In-Context Learning,\nensuring optimized content aligned with financing program requirements. The goal is to\nprovide an intelligent, accessible, and highly efficient tool that optimizes the entire funding\napplication process. The development of this AI Agent represents a significant technological\nleap, being a scalable solution with strong potential.\n\n\fJustification of Objectives\n(limit 2000)\n\nGranter.ai's mission is to democratize and facilitate access to public funding. The presented\nproject involves the creation of an AI Agent to be used by specialists and businesses in\npreparing applications for funding opportunities. The AI Agent will incorporate highly\nsophisticated methodologies, including Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and\nAdversarial In-Context Learning (Adv-ICL), applied to the generation of specialized content.\nIts development involves an intensive process of applied research, with a strong focus on\nexperimentation, fine-tuning, and validation of linguistic models adapted to the specific\ndomain of public policies and public funds, aiming to create a new tool with direct impact on\nthe market.\nThe scalability of the solution is ensured by its modular structure, which will allow rapid\nadaptation to different national contexts. The final product is expected to be easily adapted\nto any market, language, or legal context. The digital nature of the AI Agent and its\ninfrastructure, which is expected to be highly adaptable, will allow the tool to easily adapt to\nany market by simply connecting to a database containing all relevant information. With the\nlaunch of this tool, Granter expects to enter markets like Spain, Italy, and the USA by the end\nof 2025, where the demand for public funding solutions is high.\nAdditionally, Granter.ai believes the AI Agent will have a significant indirect contribution to\nthe climate transition: by facilitating access to funding programs related to sustainability and\nthe green economy, it will boost business initiatives with a positive environmental impact.\nThus, this project represents a highly differentiated technological solution capable of\ngenerating impact in the economic ecosystem, both nationally and internationally.\n\nJustification for the Typology\n(limit 5000)\n\nTypology to be selected – Support for Startup or Growth\nGranter.ai is in an early stage of accelerated growth, which clearly justifies the project's\nclassification under \"Support for Startup or Growth.\" Having started operations in December\n2024, Granter.ai has already shown consistent signs of traction and scalability potential, with\na base of over 2,500 registered companies, more than 150 submitted applications, and a total\nvolume of over 20 million euros in funded projects. Additionally, the company raised\n400,000€ in investment rounds and reports sustained quarterly growth of 45%. These\nindicators reflect a business model with strong market acceptance and clear expansion phase.\nAs part of its growth process, Granter.ai is currently developing the process for obtaining\nrecognition of competence by ANI, demonstrating the company's desire to be recognized as\na competent entity for R&D activities in its field.\n\n\fThe proposed project is unequivocally aligned with the company's growth support, as it aims\nto develop and consolidate an innovative digital product with a strong technological\nfoundation: an AI Agent for use by businesses in identifying and preparing applications for\npublic funds. This new product represents a qualitative leap in Granter.ai's value proposition\nand is critical to strengthening its competitive position in both the national and international\nmarkets, such as Spain, Italy, and the USA.\nThis project will be entirely developed with internal company resources, with plans to further\nstrengthen the team with a highly qualified new member. Developing the tool internally\ndemonstrates the company's commitment to producing proprietary software. Its\nimplementation requires the mobilization of advanced technical knowledge, with a strong\ncomponent of applied research and experimental development. The use of methodologies\nsuch as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Adversarial In-Context Learning (AdvICL) adds significant technological complexity to the project. This technological effort is\naimed at creating a robust, intuitive, and highly effective solution that meets the specific\nneeds of users.\nThe nature of the project - focused on the development of a digital solution with the potential\nto transform the sector - aligns with the company's growth objectives.
