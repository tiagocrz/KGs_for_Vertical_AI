For instance, instead of storing each parameter as a 32-bit floating-\npoint number, they may be represented using fewer bits, such as 8-bit integers.\nThis compression\nreduces the memory footprint of the model, making it more efficient to deploy and execute, especially in\nresource-constrained environments like mobile devices or edge devices. QLoRA is a popular example of\nthis quantisation for LLMs and can be used to deploy LLMs locally or host them on external servers.\nExample use case: Edge Device Deployment\nA tech company used quantised LLMs to deploy advanced NLP models on mobile devices, enabling offline\nfunctionality for applications such as voice recognition and translation. This deployment significantly\nimproved app performance and user experience by reducing latency and reliance on internet connectivity.\n8.3.6\nvLLMs\nThe vLLM2 system efficiently handles requests by employing a block-level memory management method\nand preemptive request scheduling. It utilises the PagedAttention[84] algorithm to manage the key-\nvalue (KV) cache, thereby reducing memory waste and fragmentation. By batching requests and sharing\nphysical blocks across multiple samples, vLLM optimises memory usage and enhances throughput. Per-\nformance tests indicate that vLLM surpasses other systems in various decoding scenarios. Consider a\ntransformer-based model tasked with summarising a lengthy book. Traditional transformers process the\nentire book simultaneously, which can be both computationally and memory-intensive, especially for ex-\ntended texts. With PagedAttention, the book is divided into smaller segments or pages. The model then\nfocuses on summarising one page at a time, rather than the entire book simultaneously. This approach\nreduces computational complexity and memory requirements, making it more feasible to process and\nsummarise lengthy texts efficiently.\nExample use case: High-Volume Content Generation\nA content marketing agency implemented vLLMs for generating large volumes of SEO-optimised content.\nBy leveraging the efficient memory management of vLLMs, they were able to handle multiple concurrent\nrequests, significantly increasing their content production rate while maintaining high quality.\n8.4\nKey Considerations for Deployment of LLMs\nDeploying large language models (LLMs) effectively requires careful planning and consideration of various\nfactors to ensure optimal performance, cost-efficiency, and security. Key considerations include:\n• Infrastructure Requirements:\n– Compute Resources: Ensure adequate CPU/GPU resources to handle the model’s compu-\ntational demands. High-performance GPUs are typically required for efficient inference and\ntraining.\n– Memory: LLMs, especially those with billions of parameters, require substantial memory.\nMemory management techniques such as quantisation and model parallelism can be employed\nto optimise usage.\n2https://docs.vllm.ai/en/stable/\n70\n• Scalability:\n– Horizontal Scaling: Plan for horizontal scaling to distribute the load across multiple servers,\nwhich can improve performance and handle increased demand.\n– Load Balancing: Implement load balancing strategies to ensure even distribution of requests\nand prevent any single point of failure.\n• Cost Management:\n– Token-based Pricing: Understand the cost implications of token-based pricing models of-\nfered by cloud providers. This model charges based on the number of tokens processed, which\ncan become expensive with high usage.\n– Self-Hosting: Evaluate the costs and benefits of self-hosting versus cloud hosting.\nSelf-\nhosting might offer long-term savings for consistent, high-volume usage but requires significant\nupfront investment in hardware and ongoing maintenance.\n• Performance Optimisation:\n– Latency: Minimise latency to ensure real-time performance, particularly for applications\nrequiring instant responses like chatbots and virtual assistants.\n– Throughput: Maximise throughput to handle a high volume of requests efficiently. Tech-\nniques like batching and efficient memory management (e.g., PagedAttention) can help.\n• Security and Privacy:\n– Data Security: Implement robust security measures to protect sensitive data, including\nencryption and secure access controls.\n– Privacy: Ensure compliance with data privacy regulations by keeping sensitive data within\nyour environment if self-hosting, or ensuring cloud providers comply with relevant privacy\nstandards.\n• Maintenance and Updates:\n– Model Updates: Regularly update the model to incorporate new data and improve perfor-\nmance. Automate this process if possible to reduce manual effort.\n– System Maintenance: Plan for regular maintenance of the infrastructure to prevent down-\ntime and ensure smooth operation.\n• Flexibility and Customisation:\n– Fine-Tuning:\nAllow for model fine-tuning to adapt the LLM to specific use cases and\ndatasets. Fine-tuning can improve accuracy and relevance in responses.\n– API Integration: Ensure the deployment platform supports easy integration with existing\nsystems and workflows through APIs and SDKs.\n• User Management:\n– Access Control: Implement role-based access control to manage who can deploy, use, and\nmaintain the LLM.\n– Monitoring and Logging: Set up comprehensive monitoring and logging to track usage,\nperformance, and potential issues. This helps in proactive troubleshooting and optimisation.\n• Compliance:\n– Regulatory Compliance: Ensure that the deployment adheres to all relevant regulatory\nand legal requirements, including data protection laws like GDPR, HIPAA, etc.\n– Ethical Considerations: Implement ethical guidelines to avoid biases and ensure the re-\nsponsible use of LLMs.\n• Support and Documentation:\n– Technical Support: Choose a deployment platform that offers robust technical support and\nresources.\n– Documentation: Provide comprehensive documentation for developers and users to facili-\ntate smooth deployment and usage.\n71\nChapter 9\nStage 7: Monitoring and\nMaintenance\n9.1\nSteps Involved in Monitoring and Maintenance of Deployed\nFine-Tuned LLMs\nContinuous monitoring and maintenance of fine-tuned LLMs are essential\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama3.2:3b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_f1a29e94a2b9aa9800f62780195f0ae4bea95e6b0a833ca3ca0914cad8e78b19_v2"}
