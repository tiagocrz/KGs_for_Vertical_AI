Full fine-tuning up-\ndates all parameters of the model, ensuring comprehensive adaptation to the new task. Alternatively, Half\nfine-tuning (HFT) [15] or Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) approaches, such as using adapter\nlayers, can be employed to partially fine-tune the model. This method attaches additional layers to the\npre-trained model, allowing for efficient fine-tuning with fewer parameters, which can address challenges\nrelated to computational efficiency, overfitting, and optimisation.\n2.5\nStage 5: Evaluation and Validation\nEvaluation and validation involve assessing the fine-tuned LLM’s performance on unseen data to ensure\nit generalises well and meets the desired objectives. Evaluation metrics, such as cross-entropy, measure\nprediction errors, while validation monitors loss curves and other performance indicators to detect issues\nlike overfitting or underfitting.\nThis stage helps guide further fine-tuning to achieve optimal model\nperformance.\n15\n2.6\nStage 6: Deployment\nDeploying an LLM means making it operational and accessible for specific applications. This involves\nconfiguring the model to run efficiently on designated hardware or software platforms, ensuring it can\nhandle tasks like natural language processing, text generation, or user query understanding. Deployment\nalso includes setting up integration, security measures, and monitoring systems to ensure reliable and\nsecure performance in real-world applications.\n2.7\nStage 7: Monitoring and Maintenance\nMonitoring and maintaining an LLM after deployment is crucial to ensure ongoing performance and\nreliability.\nThis involves continuously tracking the model’s performance, addressing any issues that\narise, and updating the model as needed to adapt to new data or changing requirements.\nEffective\nmonitoring and maintenance help sustain the model’s accuracy and effectiveness over time.\n16\nChapter 3\nStage 1: Data Preparation\n3.1\nSteps Involved in Data Preparation\n3.1.1\nData Collection\nThe first step in data preparation is to collect data from various sources. These sources can be in any\nformat such as CSV, web pages, SQL databases, S3 storage, etc. Python provides several libraries to\ngather the data efficiently and accurately. Table 3.1 presents a selection of commonly used data formats\nalong with the corresponding Python libraries used for data collection.\n3.1.2\nData Preprocessing and Formatting\nData preprocessing and formatting are crucial for ensuring high-quality data for fine-tuning. This step\ninvolves tasks such as cleaning the data, handling missing values, and formatting the data to match the\nspecific requirements of the task. Several libraries assist with text data processing and Table 3.2 contains\nsome of the most commonly used data preprocessing libraries in python.\n3.1.3\nHandling Data Imbalance\nHandling imbalanced datasets is crucial for ensuring balanced performance across all classes. Several\ntechniques and strategies are employed:\n1. Over-sampling and Under-sampling:\nTechniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-\nsampling Technique) generate synthetic examples to achieve balance.\nPython Library: imbalanced-learn\nDescription: imbalanced-learn provides various methods to deal with imbalanced datasets, in-\ncluding oversampling techniques like SMOTE.\n2. Adjusting Loss Function: Modify the loss function to give more weight to the minority class,\nsetting class weights inversely proportional to the class frequencies.\n3. Focal Loss: A variant of cross-entropy loss that adds a factor to down-weight easy examples and\nfocus training on hard negatives.\nPython Library: focal loss\nDescription: The focal loss package provides robust implementations of various focal loss func-\ntions, including BinaryFocalLoss and SparseCategoricalFocalLoss.\n4. Cost-sensitive Learning: Incorporating the cost of misclassifications directly into the learning\nalgorithm, assigning a higher cost to misclassifying minority class samples.\n5. Ensemble Methods: Using techniques like bagging and boosting to combine multiple models\nand handle class imbalance.\nPython Library: sklearn.ensemble\nDescription: scikit-learn provides robust implementations of various ensemble methods, including\nbagging and boosting.\n17\nData Format\nPython\nLi-\nbrary\nDescription\nLibrary Link\nCSV Files\npandas\npandas is a powerful library for data ma-\nnipulation and analysis.
