This practice not only aids in debugging and further development but also facilitates\ncollaboration and sharing of results with the broader research community.\n33\nChapter 6\nStage 4: Selection of Fine-Tuning\nTechniques and Appropriate Model\nConfigurations\nThis chapter focuses on selecting appropriate fine-tuning techniques and model configurations that suit\nthe specific requirements of various tasks. Fine-tuning is a crucial stage where pre-trained models are\nadapted to specific tasks or domains.\n6.1\nSteps Involved in Fine-Tuning\nThe following steps outline the fine-tuning process, integrating advanced techniques and best practices.\n1. Initialise the Pre-Trained Tokenizer and Model: Begin by loading the pre-trained tokenizer\nand model. The tokenizer ensures that the input text is converted into a format the model can\nprocess, while the pre-trained model serves as the foundation for further adaptation. Depending\non the task, select a model that has been pre-trained on relevant data to provide a strong starting\npoint.\n2. Modify the Model’s Output Layer: Adjust the model’s output layer to align with the specific\nrequirements of the target task. This may involve modifying existing layers or adding new layers.\nFor instance, tasks like classification may require a softmax layer with the appropriate number of\nclasses, while text generation tasks might involve changes in the decoding mechanism.\n3. Choose an Appropriate Fine-Tuning Strategy: Select the fine-tuning strategy that best fits\nthe task and the model architecture. Some Options include:\n• Task-Specific Fine-Tuning: For tasks such as text summarisation, code generation, classi-\nfication, and question answering, adapt the model using relevant datasets.\n• Domain-Specific Fine-Tuning: Tailor the model to comprehend and generate text relevant\nto specific domains, such as medical, financial, or legal fields.\n• Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT): Techniques like LoRA, QLoRA, and adapters\nallow for fine-tuning with reduced computational costs by updating a small subset of model\nparameters.\n• Half Fine-Tuning (HFT): Balance between retaining pre-trained knowledge and learning\nnew tasks by updating only half of the model’s parameters during each fine-tuning round.\n4. Set Up the Training Loop: Establish the training loop, incorporating the selected fine-tuning\nstrategy. The loop should include data loading, loss computation, backpropagation, and parameter\nupdates.\nWhen using PEFT methods, ensure that only the relevant parameters are updated\nto maximise efficiency. Implement techniques like dynamic learning rates and early stopping to\nenhance the training process.\n34\n5. Incorporate Techniques for Handling Multiple Tasks: If fine-tuning for multiple tasks,\nconsider strategies like fine-tuning with multiple adapters or leveraging Mixture of Experts (MoE)\narchitectures. These methods allow a single model to handle various tasks by utilising specialised\nsub-networks or adapters for each task.\n6. Monitor Performance on a Validation Set: Regularly evaluate the model’s performance on\na validation set to ensure it generalises well to unseen data.\nAdjust hyperparameters such as\nlearning rate, batch size, and dropout rates based on the validation performance. Utilise advanced\nmonitoring tools to track metrics like accuracy, loss, and overfitting.\n7. Optimise Model Using Advanced Techniques: Employ techniques such as Proximal Policy\nOptimisation (PPO) for reinforcement learning scenarios, or Direct Preference Optimisation (DPO)\nfor aligning model outputs with human preferences. These techniques are particularly useful in\nfine-tuning models for tasks requiring nuanced decision-making or human-like responses.\n8. Prune and optimise the Model (if necessary): To deploy the model in resource-constrained\nenvironments, consider pruning techniques to reduce its size and complexity. This involves removing\nunnecessary parameters or components without significantly affecting performance. Utilise dynamic\npruning methods during inference to optimise the model on-the-fly for different scenarios.\n9. Continuous Evaluation and Iteration: Continuously evaluate the model’s performance across\nvarious tasks using appropriate benchmarks. Iterate on the fine-tuning process, making adjustments\nbased on performance metrics and real-world testing. This iterative approach helps in refining the\nmodel to meet specific performance criteria.\n6.2\nFine-Tuning Strategies for LLMs\n6.2.1\nTask-Specific Fine-Tuning\nTask-specific fine-tuning adapts large language models (LLMs) for particular downstream tasks using\nappropriately formatted and cleaned data. Below is a summary of key tasks suitable for fine-tuning\nLLMs, including examples of LLMs tailored to these tasks.\nTask\nDescription\nKey Models\nText Summarisation\nCondensing long texts into coherent sum-\nmaries while retaining key information.
