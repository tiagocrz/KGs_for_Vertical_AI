These prompts can bypass the\nembedded safety and ethical guidelines within the models, similar to code injection techniques used in\ntraditional computer security to circumvent safety protocols. Notably, models like ChatGPT, GPT-\n3, and InstructGPT are vulnerable to such manipulations that remove content generation restrictions,\npotentially violating OpenAI’s guidelines. This underscores the necessity for robust safeguards to ensure\nLLM outputs adhere to ethical and safety standards.\nDecodingTrust [79] provides a comprehensive evaluation of the trustworthiness of LLMs, notably com-\nparing GPT-4 with GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT). This evaluation spans several critical areas:\n1. Toxicity: Optimisation algorithms and generative models are employed to create challenging\nprompts that test the model’s ability to avoid generating harmful content.\n2. Stereotype Bias: An array of demographic groups and stereotype topics are utilised to assess\nmodel bias, helping to understand and mitigate prejudiced responses.\n3. Adversarial Robustness: The resilience of models against adversarial attacks is tested by chal-\nlenging them with sophisticated algorithms intended to deceive or mislead.\n4. Out-of-Distribution (OOD) Robustness: Models are evaluated on their ability to handle\ninputs that differ significantly from their training data, such as poetic or Shakespearean styles.\n5. Robustness to Adversarial Demonstrations: Demonstrations that contain misleading infor-\nmation are used to test the model’s robustness across various tasks.\n6. Privacy: Various levels of privacy evaluation assess how well models safeguard sensitive informa-\ntion during interactions and understand privacy-related contexts.\n7. Hallucination Detection: Identifies instances where the model generates information not grounded\nin the provided context or factual data. Lower hallucination rates improve the reliability and trust-\nworthiness of the LLM’s outputs.\n8. Tone Appropriateness: Assesses whether the model’s output maintains an appropriate tone for\nthe given context. This is particularly important for applications in customer service, healthcare,\nand other sensitive areas.\n9. Machine Ethics: Ethical assessments involve testing models with scenarios that require moral\njudgments, using datasets like ETHICS and Jiminy Cricket.\n10. Fairness: The fairness of models is evaluated by generating tasks that vary protected attributes,\nensuring equitable responses across different demographic groups.\nThe dataset employed for evaluating the aforementioned eight safety dimensions can be found here.\nIn partnership with HuggingFace, the LLM Safety Leaderboard utilises DecodingTrust’s framework to\nprovide a unified evaluation platform for LLM safety.\nThis allows researchers and practitioners to\nbetter understand the capabilities, limitations, and risks associated with LLMs. Users are encouraged to\nsubmit their models to HuggingFace for evaluation, ensuring they meet the evolving standards of safety\nand reliability in the field.\n7.9\nEvaluating Safety of Fine-Tuned LLM using AI Models\n7.9.1\nLlama Guard\nLlama Guard 2[80] is a safeguard model built on LLMs for managing risks in conversational AI applica-\ntions. It effectively categorises both input prompts and responses from AI agents using a detailed safety\nrisk taxonomy tailored to identify potential legal and policy risks in AI interactions. It utilises a detailed\nsafety risk taxonomy designed to identify and manage potential legal and policy risks in interactions\ninvolving conversational AI. This taxonomy enables effective classification in areas such as:\n• Violence & Hate, addressing content that could incite violent acts or discrimination.\n62\n• Sexual Content, targeting sexually explicit material or behaviour, especially involving minors.\n• Guns & Illegal Weapons, concerning the promotion or instruction of illegal armaments.\n• Regulated or Controlled Substances, covering illegal drugs and other controlled substances.\n• Suicide & Self-Harm, aimed at content that could encourage self-destructive behaviour.\n• Criminal Planning, for content that could assist in planning or executing criminal activities.\nThe core of Llama Guard 2 is its robust framework that allows for both prompt and response classifica-\ntion, supported by a high-quality dataset that enhances its ability to monitor conversational exchanges.\nOperating on a Llama2-7b model, Llama Guard 2 has been instruction-tuned to deliver strong perfor-\nmance on benchmarks like the OpenAI Moderation Evaluation dataset and ToxicChat, where it matches\nor surpasses the capabilities of existing content moderation tools.\nThe model supports multi-class classification and generates binary decision scores. Its instruction fine-\ntuning allows for extensive customisation of tasks and adaptation of output formats. This feature enables\nusers to modify taxonomy categories to align with specific use cases and supports flexible prompting\ncapabilities, including zero-shot and few-shot applications. The adaptability and effectiveness of Llama\nGuard make it a vital resource for developers and researchers. By making its model weights publicly\navailable, Llama Guard 2 encourages ongoing development and customisation to meet the evolving needs\nof AI safety within the community.\nLlama Guard 3 represents the latest advancement over Llama Guard 2, having been fine-tuned on the\nLlama 3 8b model. The key difference between the two versions is that Llama Guard 3 expands upon\nthe capabilities of Llama Guard 2 by introducing three new categories: Defamation, Elections, and\nCode Interpreter Abuse.\nPython Library: Llama Guard 3 is accessible via HuggingFace’s AutoModelForCausalLM.2 A detailed\ntutorial is available at this link.
