The audio tokens are further refined using a vocoder,\nwhile text tokens are detokenized to produce coherent text outputs (adapted from [101]).\n94\nAudio and speech LLMs like AudioPaLM[102], AudioLM[103], and various adaptations of models like\nWhisper and LLaMA, integrate capabilities for understanding and generating audio data, including\nspeech-to-text (STT), text-to-speech (TTS), and speech-to-speech (STS) translation.\nThese models\nhave shown that LLMs, initially designed for text, can be effectively adapted for audio tasks through\nsophisticated tokenization and fine-tuning techniques.\n11.4.1\nTokenization and Preprocessing\nA key aspect of adapting LLMs for audio is the tokenization of audio data into discrete representations\nthat the model can process. For instance, AudioLM and AudioPaLM utilise a combination of acoustic\nand semantic tokens. Acoustic tokens capture the high-quality audio synthesis aspect, while semantic\ntokens help maintain long-term structural coherence in the generated audio. This dual-token approach\nallows the models to handle both the intricacies of audio waveforms and the semantic content of speech.\n11.4.2\nFine-Tuning Techniques\nFine-tuning audio and speech LLMs typically involve several key strategies:\n• Full Parameter Fine-Tuning: This involves updating all the model’s parameters during fine-\ntuning. For instance, LauraGPT and SpeechGPT fine-tune all parameters to adapt pre-trained\ntext LLMs to various audio tasks, although this can be computationally expensive.\n• Layer-Specific Fine-Tuning: Techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) update only spe-\ncific layers or modules of the model. This method significantly reduces computational requirements\nwhile still allowing effective adaptation. Models like Qwen-Audio leverage LoRA to fine-tune pre-\ntrained components for enhanced performance on speech recognition tasks.\n• Component-Based Fine-Tuning: Recent models, such as those integrating the Whisper en-\ncoder, freeze certain parts of the model (like the speech encoder) and only fine-tune a linear\nprojector or specific adapters to align the speech and text modalities. This approach simplifies the\ntraining process and enhances efficiency[104].\n• Multi-Stage Fine-Tuning: Models like AudioPaLM perform multi-stage fine-tuning, starting\nwith a text-based pre-training phase, followed by fine-tuning on a mixture of tasks that include\nboth text and audio data. This staged approach leverages the strengths of pre-trained text models\nwhile adapting them for multimodal tasks.\n11.4.3\nFine-Tuning Whisper for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)\nWhisper1 is an advanced Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model developed by OpenAI, designed\nto convert spoken language into text. Built upon the powerful Transformer architecture, Whisper excels\nat capturing and transcribing diverse speech patterns across various languages and accents.\nUnlike\ntraditional ASR models that require extensive labelled data, Whisper leverages a vast dataset and self-\nsupervised learning, enabling it to perform robustly in noisy environments and handle a wide range of\nspeech variations. Its versatility and high accuracy make it an ideal choice for applications such as voice\nassistants, transcription services, and multilingual speech recognition systems.\nWhy Fine-Tune Whisper?\nFine-tuning Whisper for specific ASR tasks can significantly enhance its performance in specialised\ndomains. Although Whisper is pre-trained on a large and diverse dataset, it might not fully capture\nthe nuances of specific vocabularies or accents present in niche applications. Fine-tuning allows Whisper\nto adapt to particular audio characteristics and terminologies, leading to more accurate and reliable\ntranscriptions. This process is especially beneficial in industries with domain-specific jargon, like medical,\nlegal, or technical fields, where the generic model might struggle with specialised vocabulary.\n1https://openai.com/index/whisper/\n95\nSteps to Fine-Tune Whisper\n• Data Collection and Preparation: Gather a sizable dataset that matches the target domain or\ntask. Ensure the dataset includes diverse examples with clear transcriptions. Clean and preprocess\nthe audio files and transcripts, ensuring they are in a consistent format and aligned correctly. Tools\nlike FFmpeg2 can help standardise audio formats and sample rates.\n• Data Augmentation: To improve robustness, augment the dataset with variations such as dif-\nferent noise levels, accents, or speeds. Techniques like adding background noise, altering pitch, or\nchanging the tempo can help the model generalise better to real-world conditions.\n• Preprocessing: Convert the audio files into a format suitable for Whisper, typically into mel\nspectrograms or another time-frequency representation. This transformation is crucial as Whisper\nrelies on such representations to learn and transcribe speech effectively.\n• Model Configuration: Initialise the Whisper model with pre-trained weights. Configure the\nmodel to accommodate the target language or domain-specific adjustments. This includes setting\nappropriate hyperparameters, like learning rate and batch size, tailored to the dataset’s size and\ncomplexity.\n• Training: Fine-tune the Whisper model on the prepared dataset using a framework like PyTorch\nor TensorFlow. Ensure to monitor the model’s performance on a validation set to avoid overfitting.\nTechniques like gradient clipping, learning rate scheduling, and early stopping can help maintain\ntraining stability and efficiency.\n• Evaluation and Testing: After training, evaluate the model’s performance on a separate test\nset to assess its accuracy and generalisability. Metrics like Word Error Rate (WER) or Character\nError Rate (CER) provide insights into how well the model transcribes audio compared to ground\ntruth transcriptions.\n11.4.4\nCase Studies and Applications\n1.
