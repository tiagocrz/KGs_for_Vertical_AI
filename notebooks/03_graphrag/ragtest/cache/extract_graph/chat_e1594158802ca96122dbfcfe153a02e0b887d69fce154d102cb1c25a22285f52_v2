Conversely, utilising cloud vendors al-\nleviates concerns about resource maintenance but incurs monthly billing\ncosts. These charges are typically based on factors such as model size\nand the volume of requests per minute.\nModel Size and\nQuantisation\nutilising a pre-trained model with high memory consumption can still be\nviable by employing its quantised version. Through quantisation, pre-\ntrained weights can be loaded with reduced precision, typically 4-bit or\n8-bit floating point, substantially diminishing parameter volume while\nmaintaining considerable accuracy [40].\nPre-training Datasets\nExamine the datasets used for pre-training to gauge the model’s under-\nstanding of language. These are important as there are models available\nspecifically for performing code generation, and we do not want to use\nthose models for finance text classification [41].\nBias Awareness\nBe vigilant regarding potential biases in pre-trained models, especially if\nunbiased predictions are required. The bias awareness can be evaluated\nby testing different models and backtracking the datasets used for pre-\ntraining [42].\nTable 4.1: Comprehensive Overview of Challenges in Initialising a Large Language Model (LLM).

Setting up the training environment: When setting up the environment for training an LLM,\nit is crucial to configure high-performance hardware, such as GPUs or TPUs, and ensure proper\ninstallation of necessary software components like CUDA, cuDNN, and deep learning frameworks\nsuch as PyTorch or TensorFlow. Verify hardware recognition and compatibility with the software to\nleverage computational power effectively, reducing training time and improving model performance.\n2. Defining the Hyper-parameters: When defining hyperparameters for fine-tuning an LLM, it is\nessential to carefully tune key parameters such as learning rate, batch size, and epochs to optimise\nthe model’s performance.\n3. Initialising Optimisers and Loss Functions: When initialising optimisers and loss functions\nfor fine-tuning an LLM, it is crucial to select the appropriate optimiser to efficiently update the\nmodel’s weights and the correct loss function to measure model performance [43].\n5.2\nSetting up Training Environment\nWhen fine-tuning a large language model (LLM), the computational environment plays a crucial role in\nensuring efficient training. To achieve optimal performance, it’s essential to configure the environment\nwith high-performance hardware such as GPUs (Graphics Processing Units) or TPUs (Tensor Processing\nUnits). GPUs, such as the NVIDIA A100 or V100, are widely used for training deep learning models\ndue to their parallel processing capabilities. For larger-scale operations, TPUs offered by Google Cloud\ncan provide even greater acceleration [44].\nFirst, ensure that your system or cloud environment has the necessary hardware installed. For GPUs,\nthis involves setting up CUDA1 (Compute Unified Device Architecture) and cuDNN2 (CUDA Deep Neu-\nral Network library) from NVIDIA, which are essential for enabling GPU acceleration. For TPU usage,\nyou would typically set up a Google Cloud environment with TPU instances, which includes configuring\nthe TPU runtime in your training scripts.\nVerify that your hardware is correctly recognised and utilised by your deep learning frameworks. In\nPyTorch, for instance, you can check GPU availability with torch.cuda.is available(). Properly setting\nup and testing the hardware ensures that the training process can leverage the computational power\neffectively, reducing training time and improving model performance [36].\nWhen fine-tuning an LLM, both software and hardware considerations are paramount to ensure a smooth\nand efficient training process. On the software side, you need a compatible deep learning framework like\nPyTorch or TensorFlow. These frameworks have extensive support for LLMs and provide utilities for\nefficient model training and evaluation. Installing the latest versions of these frameworks, along with\nany necessary dependencies, is crucial for leveraging the latest features and performance improvements\n1https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit\n2https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn\n26\n[45].\nAdditionally, use libraries like Hugging Face’s transformers to simplify the process of loading pre-trained\nmodels and tokenizers. This library is particularly well-suited for working with various LLMs and offers\na user-friendly interface for model fine-tuning. Ensure that all software components, including libraries\nand dependencies, are compatible with your chosen framework and hardware setup [35].\nOn the hardware side, consider the memory requirements of the model and your dataset. LLMs typ-\nically require substantial GPU memory, so opting for GPUs with higher VRAM (e.g., 16GB or more)\ncan be beneficial. If your model is exceptionally large or if you are training with very large datasets,\ndistributed training across multiple GPUs or TPUs might be necessary. This requires a careful setup of\ndata parallelism or model parallelism techniques to efficiently utilise the available hardware [46].\nLastly, ensure robust cooling and power supply for your hardware, as training LLMs can be resource-\nintensive, generating\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "llama3.2:3b", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_e1594158802ca96122dbfcfe153a02e0b887d69fce154d102cb1c25a22285f52_v2"}
