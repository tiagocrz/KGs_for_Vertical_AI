This task is inherently complex, requiring the model to understand syntax,\nsemantics, and context deeply.\n7.2.2\nBeyond Cross-Entropy: Advanced LLM Evaluation Metrics\nWhile cross-entropy remains fundamental, evaluating LLMs effectively necessitates additional metrics\ntailored to various aspects of model performance. Here are some advanced metrics employed in LLM\nevaluation:\nPerplexity\nPerplexity measures how well a probability distribution or model predicts a sample. In the context of\nLLMs, it evaluates the model’s uncertainty about the next word in a sequence. Lower perplexity indicates\nbetter performance, as the model is more confident in its predictions.\n57\nFactuality\nFactuality assesses the accuracy of the information produced by the LLM. It is particularly important for\napplications where misinformation could have serious consequences. Higher factuality scores correlate\nwith higher output quality.\nLLM Uncertainty\nLLM uncertainty is measured using log probability, helping to identify low-quality generations. Lower\nuncertainty indicates higher output quality. This metric leverages the log probability of each generated\ntoken, providing insights into the model’s confidence in its responses.\nPrompt Perplexity\nThis metric evaluates how well the model understands the input prompt.\nLower prompt perplexity\nindicates a clear and comprehensible prompt, which is likely to yield better model performance.\nContext Relevance\nIn retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, context relevance measures how pertinent the re-\ntrieved context is to the user query. Higher context relevance improves the quality of generated responses\nby ensuring that the model utilises the most relevant information.\nCompleteness\nCompleteness assesses whether the model’s response fully addresses the query based on the provided\ncontext. High completeness ensures that all relevant information is included in the response, enhancing\nits utility and accuracy.\nChunk Attribution and Utilisation\nThese metrics evaluate how effectively the retrieved chunks of information contribute to the final response.\nHigher chunk attribution and utilisation scores indicate that the model is efficiently using the available\ncontext to generate accurate and relevant answers.\nData Error Potential\nThis metric quantifies the difficulty the model faces in learning from the training data. Higher data\nquality results in lower error potential, leading to better model performance.\nSafety Metrics\nSafety metrics ensure that the LLM’s outputs are appropriate and non-harmful. These are included in\nthe final sections of the chapter.\nIntegrating these advanced metrics provides a holistic view of LLM performance, enabling developers to\nfine-tune and optimise models more effectively. By employing a metrics-first approach, it is possible to\nensure that LLMs not only produce accurate and high-quality outputs but also do so consistently and\nreliably across diverse applications1.\n7.3\nUnderstanding the Training Loss Curve\nThe training loss curve plots the loss value against training epochs and is essential for monitoring model\nperformance.\n1https://www.rungalileo.io/blog/metrics-first-approach-to-llm-evaluation\n58\n7.3.1\nInterpreting Loss Curves\nAn ideal training loss curve shows a rapid decrease in loss during initial stages, followed by a gradual\ndecline and eventual plateau. Specific patterns to look for include:\n1. Underfitting: High loss value that does not decrease significantly over time, suggesting the model\ncannot learn the data.\n2. Overfitting: Decreasing training loss with increasing validation loss, indicating the model mem-\norises the training data.\n3. Fluctuations: Significant variations may indicate a high learning rate or noisy gradients.\nFigure 7.1: Example training loss curve showing the decline in loss over iterations during the fine-tuning\nof Llama2 13B on a financial Q/A dataset. The curve illustrates the effectiveness of the fine-tuning\nprocess in reducing the loss and improving model performance.\n7.3.2\nAvoiding Overfitting\nTechniques to prevent overfitting include:\n1. Regularisation: Adds a penalty term to the loss function to encourage smaller weights.\n2. Early Stopping: Stops training when validation performance no longer improves.\n3. Dropout: Randomly deactivates neurons during training to reduce sensitivity to noise.\n4. Cross-Validation: Splits data into multiple subsets for training and validation to assess model\ngeneralisation.\n5. Batch Normalisation: Normalises inputs to each layer during training to stabilise the learning\nprocess.\n6. Larger Datasets and Batch Sizes: Reduces overfitting by increasing the amount of diverse\ndata and batch sizes.\n59\n7.3.3\nSources of Noisy Gradients\nNoisy gradients are common during the training of machine learning models, including LLMs. They arise\nfrom variability in gradient estimates due to stochastic gradient descent and its variants. Strategies to\nmanage noisy gradients include:\n1. Learning Rate Scheduling: Gradually decreasing the learning rate during training can reduce\nthe impact of noisy gradients.\n2. Gradient Clipping: Setting a threshold for gradient values prevents large updates that can\ndestabilise training.\n7.4\nRunning Validation Loops\nValidation loops provide an unbiased evaluation of model performance. Typical steps include:\n1. Split Data: Divide the dataset into training and validation sets.\n2. Initialise Validation: Evaluate the model on the validation set at the end of each epoch.\n3. Calculate Metrics: Compute relevant performance metrics, such as cross-entropy loss.\n4.
