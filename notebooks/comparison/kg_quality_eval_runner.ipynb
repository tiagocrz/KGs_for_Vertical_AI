    "- **isolated_nodes**: Number of nodes with no connections (degree zero). High values may indicate disconnected or unused entities.\n",
    "- **connected_components**: Number of separate subgraphs in the KG. A lower number is better for retrieval, as it means the graph is more unified.\n",
    "- **largest_component_ratio**: Fraction of nodes in the largest connected component. Values close to 1 mean most nodes are reachable from each other.\n",

      "\n",
      "- **Size and Connectivity:**\n",
      "  - Report 2 has nearly double the number of nodes (62 vs. 32) and edges (31 vs. 16), indicating a larger and more connected graph.\n",
      "  - Both reports have no isolated nodes, but Report 2 has more connected components (31 vs. 16), suggesting it is more fragmented overall.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Density and Clustering:**\n",
      "  - Report 1 has a slightly higher density (0.0323 vs. 0.0164), but both are very low, indicating sparse relationships.\n",
      "  - Both have zero clustering coefficient, implying little local grouping or tightly-knit communities.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Largest Component Ratio:**\n",
      "  - Report 1's largest component contains only 6.2% of nodes, whereas Report 2's largest component contains 3.2%. Despite being smaller, Report 2's larger size and higher overall scores suggest better structural health.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Quality Scores:**\n",
      "  - Report 2's overall quality score (0.262) is significantly higher than Report 1's (0.019), indicating better structural quality.\n",
      "  - Report 2 scores well on connectivity and density (both 0.361), reflecting a more meaningful and interconnected graph.\n",
      "  - Report 1's scores are near zero across all metrics, highlighting poor connectivity and structure.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Strengths and Weaknesses:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Report 2:**\n",
      "  - Strengths: Larger size, better overall quality score, higher connectivity and density scores.\n",
      "  - Weaknesses: Very low largest component ratio (0.032), indicating most nodes are isolated or in small components, which may hinder retrieval.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **Report 1:**\n",
      "  - Strengths: Minimal number of isolated nodes and fewer components, but overall very weak in structure.\n",
      "  - Weaknesses: Extremely low scores across all metrics, small size, and minimal connectivity, making it less effective for retrieval.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Suggestions for Improvements:**\n",
      "\n",
      "- **For Report 2:**\n",
      "  - Increase the size of the largest connected component to improve graph cohesion.\n",
      "  - Reduce the number of disconnected components by adding more relationships.\n",
      "  - Enhance local clustering to create more tightly-knit groups, improving contextual relevance.\n",
      "\n",
      "- **For Report 1:**\n",
      "  - Expand the graph by adding more nodes and relationships to increase density and connectivity.\n",
      "  - Connect isolated nodes to the main components to reduce fragmentation.\n",
      "  - Develop more relationships to improve clustering and overall structural quality, boosting the overall score.\n"
