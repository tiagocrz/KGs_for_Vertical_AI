    "- **connected_components**: Number of separate subgraphs in the KG. A lower number is better for retrieval, as it means the graph is more unified.\n",
    "- **largest_component_ratio**: Fraction of nodes in the largest connected component. Values close to 1 mean most nodes are reachable from each other.\n",
